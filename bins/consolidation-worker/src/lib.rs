//! `humaux-consolidation-worker` — `humaux-consolidation-worker`'s orchestration logic (§11.7/§11.8 T4.6+T4.7), split
//!   into a library target so `tests/run_once_e2e.rs` can drive [`run_once`] against a real `ConsolidationDbPool` — a
//!   binary-only crate has no target integration tests can link against, which is exactly why no test ever exercised
//!   this function before this review (major finding: `run_once` had zero callers and zero test coverage anywhere in
//!   the workspace).
//! Depends-on: crates=[async-trait, humaux-adapters, humaux-application, humaux-domain, serde_json, uuid]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[adapters::consolidate_repo, adapters::consolidation_reasoner, adapters::jobs, adapters::postgres, application::consolidate, domain::authority, domain::consolidate, domain::error]
//! Called-by: [consolidation-worker::main, tests]
//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: Baseline §11.8; §78
//!
//! `src/main.rs` is now the thin process-entry shell; this file is the tested part.
//!
//! §11.8 hard boundary this crate's dependency graph enforces structurally (see `Cargo.toml`'s
//! doc comment): it owns [`ConsolidationDbPool`] and nothing else capability-shaped — no
//! private-worker pool type, no BYOK decrypt client. Its only inference path is
//! [`PrivateReasoningPort`], a trait object built per run by the caller's factory
//! ([`run_once_bound`]'s `bind_port`) — this crate never names a concrete client type in its
//! orchestration; `src/main.rs` supplies the real `UdsInferenceClient` bound to the run id.
//!
//! §78 single-source: the input manifest hash and the rollup output parser live in
//! `humaux_adapters::consolidation_reasoner` and are shared with `humaux-private-worker` —
//! the two hop ends can only agree on "what was sent" if they hash the same bytes the same way.
