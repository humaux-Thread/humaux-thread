//!   ADR-0015's Consolidate hop). Dispatch is ADR-0058's: one `DERIVED_DISTILL` job = one Evidence, claimed through
//!   the four provider slots, worked by at most IN_FLIGHT seats of one task.
//! Depends-on: crates=[hex, humaux-adapters, humaux-application, humaux-domain, humaux-projection, humaux-telemetry, serde_json, sha2, tokio, uuid]; services=[PostgreSQL(role_private_worker)]; env=[HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_CANDIDATE_TTL_SECONDS]; modules=[adapters::affect_repo, adapters::attribution_repo, adapters::byok, adapters::contribution_reasoner, adapters::distill_reasoner, adapters::distill_repo, adapters::jobs, adapters::postgres, adapters::reasoning_route_admission, application::consolidate, domain::authority, domain::dataclass, domain::error, domain::evidence, domain::ids, domain::memory, domain::policy, humaux-private-worker, projection::fingerprint, telemetry::metrics]
//! Called-by: [private-worker::main, tests]
//! Invariants: [a candidate over the §10.1 origin-bound ceiling is rejected, never downgraded; one job = one Evidence
//!   and a job only takes its own Evidence's outbox row; at most IN_FLIGHT seats per process and four bound slots
//!   across all processes; a lost lease never drops an in-flight call; the deadline cuts only the HTTP future; an
//!   attempt is an admitted provider request; DEAD only with its outbox row FAILED in the same transaction; a
//!   refused retry settles as its exhausted budget; memories, run completion, job settle and outbox flip commit in
//!   one generation-fenced transaction; only a fence refusal is a lost lease, an escaped error is ERROR (ADR-0058
//!   R3); an invalid inferred affect drops the reply's affects, never its memories (R1); a drain names why it stopped,
//!   no_slot or no_work (R5); a route whose credential reference is not in the worker's key map is NOT_READY
//!   CREDENTIAL_NOT_MAPPED before any ledger row or provider call (refused by its route instance, ADR-0060 D-B);
//!   a route parked for its health is NOT_READY ROUTE_HEALTH_STALE / ROUTE_HEALTH_DENIED; a SUCCEEDED call renews
//!   its route's health near expiry and a provider 401 records the credential INVALID (ruling E3); a RETRY settle
//!   with class TRANSPORT counts `dns_pin_deferred_total` only while a DNS pin is configured (ADR-0066 D-P)]
//! Spec: Baseline §16.1.1; §10.1; ADR-0016; §15.7; §67.2; §11; §11.2.5; ADR-0058; ADR-0059; ADR-0060 D-B; ADR-0060 D-M;

//! One job (ADR-0058 D-C): take the job's own outbox row, (a) check the Evidence still names the
//! job's reasoning domain, resolve the admitted Distill route, load the Evidence, record the
//! §16.1.1 processing run (fingerprint first — before any bytes leave), (b) reserve the ledger and
//! disclosure rows, ask `ops.begin_call` to admit the request (the attempt is counted there), send
//! it, (c) parse fail-closed, authorize each candidate against §10.1's origin-bound ceiling —
//! over-ceiling candidates are rejected with a reason and never downgraded — and commit the job
//! settle (first, generation-fenced), the surviving memories, the run's completion and the outbox
//! DONE flip in ONE transaction (idempotency, ADR-0016 D5 / ADR-0058 D-E).
//!
//! Settles (ADR-0058 D-D/D-F/D-H): anything before the first admitted request is NOT_READY (backs
//! off, parks as WAITING_KEY past the park age, never spends an attempt) — including a request the
//! tenant's §72.3 budget refused (`PROVIDER_BUDGET`, D-T); a DB/reasoning error after an admitted
//! request settles one fenced RETRY in a fresh transaction (D-E); a provider 401 parks as
//! WAITING_KEY and reverts its attempt (§11); any other failed call is RETRY with the capped
//! backoff, or DEAD with its class once `max_attempts` calls were spent — DEAD always flips the
//! outbox row FAILED in the same transaction, so the ticket ends as `distill_failed` and the
//! tenant's later rows keep flowing (§15.7). Input-bound rejections (Evidence gone) settle the
//! outbox FAILED and the job DONE.
//!
//! Tickets: remember already issued the `projection.stream_log` row for this Evidence; once the
//! outbox row is DONE the retrieval worker resolves it through `memory_evidence` (or settles it
//! as a no-op when the answer was "nothing memorable", `projection_worker` D6).
