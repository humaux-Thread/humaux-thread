//! `adapters::tests::support::token_keys` — installs one per-process random consistency-token key set for test
//!   binaries that issue or verify tokens through the production entry points.
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-adapters]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[adapters::retrieve]
//! Called-by: [adapters::tests::evidence_sources, adapters::tests::outbox_batch_remember,
//!   adapters::tests::private_projection_registry, adapters::tests::projection_claim, adapters::tests::projection_worker,
//!   adapters::tests::retrieve_read_your_writes, adapters::tests::support::governance_ops,
//!   adapters::tests::support::operation_receipt_fixture]
//! Invariants: [the key is generated at run time, never a literal, and never printed; the first install in a process
//!   wins and every later call is a no-op, so fixtures that each include this file share one key set]
//! Spec: Baseline §15.5; ADR-0059 D-G
