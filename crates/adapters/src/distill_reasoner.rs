//! `adapters::distill_reasoner` — §15.5 / §16.1.1 / §10.1 Distill inference (ADR-0016) — the private-worker reasoner
//!   that turns ONE accepted Evidence into 0..N memory candidates.
//! Depends-on: crates=[hex, humaux-application, humaux-domain, humaux-projection, serde_json, sha2, sqlx, uuid]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[adapters::affect_repo, adapters::byok, adapters::consolidate_repo, adapters::consolidation_reasoner, adapters::contribution_reasoner, adapters::disclosure, adapters::memory_repo, adapters::model_call_ledger, adapters::postgres, adapters::reasoning_route_admission, application::consolidate, domain::affect, domain::authority, domain::dataclass, domain::error, domain::evidence, domain::ledger, domain::memory]
//! Called-by: [adapters::consolidation_reasoner, private-worker::distill, tests]
//! Invariants: [reuses the shared provider pipeline (admission -> egress permit -> disclosure reserve -> provider ->
//!   finalize) with purpose Distill and the same model_call_ledger leg; no second provider path; any step failing
//!   returns an error before memories are written; the HTTP cutoff cuts only the provider future, an answer that
//!   arrived is always finalized (ADR-0058 D-J)]
//! Spec: ADR-0042; §19.1; §7.4; ADR-0015; §10.1; ADR-0048; ADR-0058; ADR-0060 D-B; ADR-0060 D-C; ADR-0060 D-D;
//!   ADR-0060 D-M; ADR-0060 D-N
//!
//! Contract half of the hop
//! (`crate::distill_repo` is the SQL half; `bins/private-worker/src/distill.rs` drives both).
//!
//! Provider pipeline: exactly the `pub(crate)` steps `ContributionReasoner`/
//! `ConsolidationReasoner` already share — admission resolver → the admitted route's provider
//! instance (`ProviderFor`, ADR-0060 D-B; never a process-level provider) → `provider_matches_admission`
//! → `authorize_structured_egress` → `model_call_ledger::reserve_private_call_with_disclosure`
//! → `admitted_inference_context` → `complete_structured_timed` → `disclosure::finalize_private`
//! — with purpose `Distill`. No second provider call path. The §19.1 ledger row (carrying the
//! admitted route, ADR-0060 D-I) and the §7.4 disclosure row are reserved in ONE transaction
//! (ADR-0060 D-N, purpose `PRIVATE_DISTILL_TEXT`). A disclosure row says what left the
//! boundary; only the ledger row says what it cost and on whose account.
//!
//! The contract is versioned + hashed ([`distill_prompt_contract`], v3 — RENDERED per §10.1
//! origin ceiling (ADR-0048), per affect menu (ADR-0058 D-P) and per output channel (ADR-0058 D-M,
//! ADR-0060 D-D: one `emit_distillation` tool call when the admitted Profile declares `TOOL_CALLS`,
//! else `response_format: json_object` for `JSON_OBJECT`, else the v1 JSON content reply — chosen
//! by [`distill_output_channel`], never by provider name)): its
//! sha256 is what
//! `private.processing_runs.prompt_hash` stores and what `humaux_projection::fingerprint::
//! source_hash` folds in, so a prompt/schema/budget edit moves every Distill run's
//! `source_hash` (G16-4 axis `prompt_hash`); [`DISTILL_PARSER_VERSION`] is the `parser_version`
//! axis.
