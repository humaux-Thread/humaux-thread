//!   worker; every family a pass holds is lease-renewed while any of them is worked; per row: resolve bound memories,
//!   upsert, verify search-visible, then settle; a transient failure returns the ticket to ISSUED with backoff
//!   (bounded by max attempts, then FAILED transient_exhausted), except that a dependency-outage failure while the
//!   dependency is already known down spends no attempt; a permanent one settles FAILED at once; every settle/retry/release is fenced on (lease_owner, attempts); a DONE is never written
//!   before search-visible confirmation; every point upsert and delete is fenced on the ticket's source_stream_seq, so a
//!   reclaimed worker's late write cannot overwrite or remove a point a later ticket wrote; the fence has no
//!   tombstone, so a stale upsert that lands after a retire delete re-inserts the point (ADR-0057 D-I, known limit 9;
//!   the rebuild verifier's id-set check deletes it as an orphan, ADR-0064 D-F E3); a card whose vector is stored
//!   under the worker label's fingerprint and the same input bytes is never sealed or embedded again, and every
//!   vector that is embedded is stored in the registry transaction (ADR-0064 D-B); run_claimed_pass_for_run claims
//!   only the generation tickets of one rebuild run (ADR-0064 D-N(g)); expected_points is the rebuild verifier's
//!   Project(PG) with the same card and payload builders, read in a READ ONLY projector transaction (ADR-0064 D-F)]
//! Spec: Baseline §4.2; §15.1; §17.4; §18.2; §15.7; §6.1.2; ADR-0052; ADR-0057; ADR-0064 D-B; ADR-0064 D-F;
//!   ADR-0064 D-N
//!
//! §4.2 (line 818): there is no separate `projection-worker` process — this is
//! `humaux-retrieval-worker`'s own consumer loop, owned by `role_retrieval_worker`.
//!
//! ## What one [`run_once`] call processes
//!
//! Exactly one §15.1 stream identity (a [`StreamFamily`] + `projection_version`, i.e. one
//! [`StreamKey`]) — never "every ISSUED row across every tenant/stream in one call". A caller
//! (the `humaux-retrieval-worker` binary) instantiates one [`ProjectionWorkerDeps`] per stream
//! it is responsible for and calls [`run_once`] on a timer/loop, same shape
//! `humaux_adapters::public_repo::run_once` already uses for the public plane.
//!
//! ## Per-row order (§17.4, verbatim in the task card)
//!
//! (a) read the next ISSUED `stream_log` rows for this key: (b) resolve the bound Memories —
//! ALL `private.memory_records` rows the ticket's Evidence carries, through
//! `ops.outbox`/`private.memory_evidence` (see `resolve_memories`: one Evidence routinely
//! carries N memories, and card 9 reported that only the first one used to be projected) (c)
//! the stored vectors of the cards (ADR-0064 D-B, stored-first: when every card has one, (c') is skipped) (c')
//! seal + `embed_cards` (one batched call for the whole Evidence) (d) reject a short batch or a
//! dimension mismatch (e) build a `QdrantPointPayload` per memory (f)
//! [`crate::qdrant::upsert_fenced`] (g)
//! [`crate::private_projection_registry::register_private_memory_point_with_vector`] (the vector and the binding
//! in one transaction)
//! (h) [`crate::qdrant::verify_visible_via_transport`] (i) only then mark the row `DONE` (j)
//! [`crate::stream_repo::advance_prefix`] once for the whole batch.
//!
//! A failure at (b)-(h) is classified (ADR-0052 D-E, card 27 — before it, every failure was a
//! permanent `FAILED`, audit C4). A **permanent** one (a 4xx schema/payload refusal, a dimension
//! mismatch, an unbuildable card, a registry conflict, a terminally failed distill) settles the
//! row `FAILED` with its `error_class`; a **transient** one (PG connection/serialization/lock,
//! Qdrant transport/5xx/timeout, a provider 429/5xx, a lost registry race, an unconfirmed
//! visibility probe) returns it to the pool still `ISSUED` ([`stream_repo::release_for_retry`]),
//! with backoff, until `max_attempts` turns it into `FAILED` `transient_exhausted` — never an
//! unbounded retry (ADR-0048). `SKIPPED_BY_POLICY` stays the §18.2 policy exclusion. Either way
//! the next row runs *without* the checkpoint crossing this one — §15.7: one not-yet-DONE seq
//! blocks every later seq, so a batch that fails row N and settles row N+1 still leaves
//! `projection_highwater` at `N-1` after [`stream_repo::advance_prefix`].
//! `migrations/0011_roles_and_grants.sql`'s `projection.stream_log_guard_state_transition`
//! trigger only allows `role_retrieval_worker` to move `ISSUED -> {DONE,SKIPPED_BY_POLICY,FAILED}`;
//! the lease, the attempt counter and the backoff (migration 0176) are column writes with
//! `OLD.state = NEW.state`, which the guard admits, so a leased or backing-off ticket is still
//! `ISSUED` and there is still no in-between state for this role.
//!
//! ## The resident path: [`run_claimed_pass`] (ADR-0052)
//!
//! `humaux-retrieval-worker --serve` / `--run-once` call [`run_claimed_pass`]: the unplaced count
//! ([`stream_repo::unplaced_issued`], one `placement_missing` line), one cross-tenant claim
//! ([`stream_repo::claim_issued`], which also returns each ticket's placement; a ticket whose
//! placement does not parse is parked, never processed), then per family —
//! one worker holds a family at a time (D-A) and runs its tickets in `stream_seq` order — per
//! ticket: the exhaustion check, the family heartbeat ([`stream_repo::renew_family_leases`]; a
//! ticket not renewed was lost and is not settled), a freshly minted Qdrant permit, the same
//! [`process_row`] as below, and a fenced settle / retry / release; then one
//! [`stream_repo::advance_prefix`] per family. For the whole pass a background heartbeat renews
//! every claimed family each `lease_secs / 3`, so a family waiting behind a slow one keeps its
//! lease. A dependency-outage failure (Qdrant, provider incl. quota/budget, scanner, PG
//! connection) while [`SharedProjectionDeps::dependency_down`] is already set is released
//! without spending an attempt; the flag clears on the next `DONE`. [`run_once`] (one key, no lease) stays for the
//! adapter tests and keeps its signature.
//!
//! ## RLS and visibility
//!
//! `private.memory_records`' RLS policy (`migrations/0012_row_level_security.sql`, amended by
//! `migrations/0140_memory_records_rls_retrieval_worker_read.sql`) carves out a read-only
//! bypass for `role_retrieval_worker`, mirroring the `role_migration_owner` clause already in
//! the policy: inside the tenant-equality branch, `current_user = 'role_retrieval_worker'`
//! short-circuits the `USER_PRIVATE`/`WORKSPACE_SHARED` visibility disjunction, so this
//! tenant-scoped, headless worker can read every row of its own tenant regardless of
//! `visibility_class`/`visibility_user_id`/membership — real per-query visibility is enforced
//! downstream at Qdrant read time (§6.1.2) via the payload fields this module writes
//! (`visibility_class`/`visibility_user_id`/`visibility_workspace_id`) plus
//! `humaux_projection::dense::visibility_disjunction`, not by restricting what this worker can
//! index. The `WITH CHECK` clause is untouched — this worker never writes
//! `private.memory_records`. [`set_worker_rls_context`] still pins `humaux.user_id` to the nil
//! sentinel on every transaction (not to gate this policy — `current_user` does that — but to
//! keep a pooled connection's copy of that GUC always cast-safe for `private.evidence_objects`'
//! own, un-bypassed policy; see that function's doc for the plan-time crash this avoids).
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This module only supports `scope_kind == "workspace"` streams: [`crate::qdrant::QdrantPointPayload`]'s
//! `workspace_id` field is mandatory (not `Option`), and the only stream-routing workspace this
//! module has to offer it is the family's own `scope_id` (mirrors `remember::token_workspace_id`'s
//! "stream-routing binding, not Evidence visibility" reasoning). A `"tenant"`-scoped family is
//! rejected with [`ErrorCode::InvalidInput`] before any row is touched.
