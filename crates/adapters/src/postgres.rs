//!
//! Spec canonical path is `crates/adapters/postgres/src/pools.rs`; this repo's crate layout
//! (§58) flattens adapters into `crates/adapters/src/<name>.rs` modules, so **this file IS
//! meant to be** that sole encapsulation point — no other file in this workspace is meant to
//! name `sqlx::PgPool` (G6-DB1 assertion B).
//!
//! G80-40's static topology scan is implemented in
//! `xtask/src/architecture_check.rs`; the runtime half remains the `current_user` check and
//! SQL fixtures below. Adding a bare `PgPool` field anywhere outside this file is therefore
//! covered by the architecture gate as well as the compile-time sentinels.
//!
//! Closed set (§6.2.3): eight newtypes, one per role that holds a standing connection pool
//! (four landed with T1.4; T3.3+T3.4 adds `RetrievalWorkerDbPool` / `MaintenanceDbPool`, and
//! Phase 9 adds `PublicWorkerDbPool`; operational observations add read-only `AdminDbPool` —
//! §15.4 `advance_prefix`'s `projection_highwater` write and §15.2's `ISSUED -> LOST` sweep
//! are each the *only* legal writer of their respective column/transition per the §6.2.2
//! grant matrix and `stream_log_guard_state_transition`'s per-`current_user` transition set
//! in `0011_roles_and_grants.sql`, so each needs its own role-scoped pool rather than reusing
//! one of the original four). `inner` is private to this module on every wrapper; none of
//! them implement `From`/`Into` of one another, `Deref<Target = PgPool>`, or `Clone` — a
//! leaked `PgPool` (via any of those) would let a caller run SQL under the wrong role's
//! grants, defeating the entire point of the closed set. Application ports must take
//! `&RuntimeDbPool` / `&BatchIssuerDbPool` / `&ConsolidationDbPool` / `&PrivateWorkerDbPool` /
//! `&RetrievalWorkerDbPool` / `&MaintenanceDbPool` / `&PublicWorkerDbPool` / `&AdminDbPool` by name, never a bare `PgPool` (G6-DB1
//! `tests/ui/pass_*` / `fail_*` fixtures cover the five wrappers currently exposed by typed
//! compile-pass ports; all eight wrappers use the same `connect_checked` construction path.
