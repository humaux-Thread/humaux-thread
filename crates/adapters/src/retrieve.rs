//! Invariants: [read-your-writes on role_gateway: an expired token, cross-tenant/workspace scope or a changed serving
//!   projection is a typed RetrieveError, never a stale answer passed off as caught up; the read-route visible count
//!   is caller-scoped (family_probe), the visibility-free stream count serves ops callers only (ADR-0057 D-C);
//!   the consistency token is MAC-verified before any field is parsed and carries no authorization (ADR-0059 D-G);
//!   the RYW overlay never shows a rebuild generation's stream_log row (ADR-0064 D-A, E13); the query-hash log MAC is
//!   derived here from the installed token key and leaves this module only as a digest and a kid (ADR-0081 D-A); the card
//!   slot reported for a hydrated Memory is the registry row of the first candidate point that resolved to it, never a
//!   Qdrant payload (ADR-0084 D-C 3)]
//! Spec: Baseline §6.2.3, §15.5; ADR-0057; ADR-0059; ADR-0064; ADR-0081; ADR-0084 D-C
//!
//! **Why this lives in `humaux-adapters`, not `humaux-application`**: every function below
//! that touches PostgreSQL needs `&RuntimeDbPool`, and [`crate::postgres::RuntimeDbPool`]'s
//! `pool()` accessor is `pub(crate)` to this crate on purpose (§6.2.3 closed-set doctrine —
//! see that module's doc comment). `humaux-application` cannot extract a query surface from
//! the type even if it depended on this crate to name it. T3.5's sibling module
//! (`crate::jobs`, `ops.jobs` SKIP LOCKED claim) already established the working precedent
//! for Phase 3 J*-wave DB-backed logic: the real implementation lands here, and
//! `humaux_application::retrieve` stays the unfilled T0.x placeholder. This module follows
//! that precedent rather than the (stale, pre-J3) task brief's literal file path, to avoid a
//! `crates/application/Cargo.toml` dependency edit against a shared file with no compile-time
//! way to use the added dependency anyway (see the doc comment cited above).
//!
//! Token format is self-contained here (hex-encoded field list + key id + HMAC-SHA256, ADR-0059
//! D-G) rather than reusing `humaux_projection::stream::StreamKey`'s `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (it derives
//! neither, and this module does not own that file to add them). [`issue_consistency_token`]
//! is the only encoder: `crate::remember::remember` builds [`TokenClaims`] from its in-transaction
//! Evidence/stream write and returns the result only after commit, so every returned token is
//! accepted by [`recall_with_overlay`] without a compatibility parser.

///    `?` on `serving_version` below is that rule; §4.4 坑5 is the same rule stated once more.
///    Its other half: the serving version must also be the version `ledger` was closed at, or
///    A2 would compare two different faces — see the `serving_version != key.projection_version`
///    guard's own comment.
/// 2. **The filter comes from the shared builder, never by hand** (§17.1). [`VisibleCountFilter`]
///    is constructed only through `projection::dense::build_dense_filter`, which unconditionally
///    ANDs the tenant clause and the §6.1.2 visibility disjunction onto whatever it is asked to
///    narrow by — so this count sees exactly the point set the caller is allowed to see, and a
///    hand-written second filter (the failure `crates/projection/tests/no_handwritten_filter_scan.rs`
///    pins) cannot arise here. It narrows by `projection_version` **only**: A2's right-hand side
///    (`ledger.done`) is a whole-stream number that no `recall.search` argument narrows, so
///    carrying this request's `subject_ids` / `affect` / `embedding_version` clauses into the
///    left-hand side would shrink `visible` against an unshrunk `done` and manufacture
///    `PROJECTION_INVISIBLE_LOSS` on every narrowed read. Same reason `visible` is compared with
///    the *stream* ledger and not with the returned item count.
/// 3. **Tombstones are excluded by the overlay, not by arithmetic** (§37/§23.1②). §37 step 5's
///    physical purge is asynchronous (and, on this deployment, not wired at all), so a
///    `TOMBSTONED` row's point is usually still in the index and still matches the filter;
///    counting it would inflate A2's left-hand side by exactly `ledger.deleted`. The exclusion
///    rides the same `count` request
///    ([`crate::qdrant::count_visible_excluding_seqs`]) rather than being subtracted afterwards,
///    so it stays correct whichever side of the purge the read lands on.
