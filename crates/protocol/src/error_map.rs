//! `protocol::error_map` — the MCP/REST adapter's `ErrorCode` mapping (§52.1: "MCP/REST adapter 负责映射，Domain 不产生 HTTP
//!   status").
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-domain]; services=[];
//!   env=[]; modules=[domain::error]
//! Called-by: [protocol::mcp, tests]
//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: §52.1; §52.4
//!
//! Domain
//! itself never chooses an HTTP status or a JSON-RPC error code — this
//! module is where that choice lives.
//!
//! `lookup` is an exhaustive `match ErrorCode` rather than a hand-written
//! array searched at runtime (§52.4 G52-2): a new `ErrorCode` variant that
//! has no arm here fails to *compile*, instead of `lookup` panicking the
//! first time that variant is looked up in production. This closes the
//! second of G52-2's three counts — the adapter mapping — onto the same
//! compiler-enforced list that defines `ErrorCode` itself (see
//! `humaux_domain::error::error_code!`); only §52.1's prose code block
//! remains a count kept in sync by hand.
