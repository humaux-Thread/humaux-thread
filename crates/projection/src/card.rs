//! `projection::card` — T5.7/T5.8 RetrievalCard deterministic assembly (§18).
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-domain, sha2, uuid]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[domain::authority,
//!   domain::dataclass, domain::ids, domain::memory]
//! Called-by: [adapters::private_projection_registry, adapters::projection_worker, adapters::qdrant, humaux-local-secret-scan, tests, xtask::card_version]
//! Invariants: [build_card is a pure, non-async function with no client/key/network handle (§18.1), so identical
//!   source_hash inputs always produce identical card bytes]
//! Spec: Baseline §18.1; §16; §3; §78.3; §18.4; §18.2; §22; §22.1
//!
//! ## §18.1: assembly, not generation
//!
//! §18.1 freezes the production method: "纯确定性拼装（Rust 纯函数，零外部模型调用）" — an
//! LLM-authored card would make `source_hash`-identical writes produce different card bytes
//! (breaking §16 projection replay) and would tie card existence to a BYOK key's liveness
//! (turning a knowledge gap into a *retrieval* gap, §18.1). [`build_card`] enforces this by
//! *type*, not by discipline: it is not `async`, its signature takes no client/key/network
//! handle of any kind, and this module imports nothing HTTP/SQLx/Qdrant/provider-SDK-shaped
//! (§3/§78.3 — nothing in `humaux-projection`'s dependency graph is HTTP/SQLx/Qdrant/
//! provider-SDK-shaped; besides `humaux-domain` its `Cargo.toml` only adds `uuid`/`sha2`, both
//! plain hashing/id-formatting libraries with no network or provider surface). A caller cannot
//! route this function through a model call; there is no parameter to hand one to.
//!
//! ## §18.4: one version axis
//!
//! [`CARD_BUILDER_VERSION`] is the *only* version axis (§18.4 frozen ruling: the second-axis
//! name §18.4 retired — spelled out there, deliberately not reproduced here so this doc comment
//! itself doesn't trip the scan below — does not appear anywhere in this module's own source,
//! continuously enforced by `xtask card-version`'s dedicated retired-name scan, T5.8 review).
//! [`CARD_TEMPLATE_HASH`] is not a second axis; it is this builder version's own template
//! content fingerprint — §18.4: "同 `card_builder_version` 必同 `card_template_hash`". Bump
//! both together whenever [`assemble`]'s separator/placeholder shape changes; `xtask
//! card-version` fails the build the moment two different hashes show up under one version, and
//! also fails the moment [`CARD_TEMPLATE_HASH`] stops matching [`template_fingerprint`]'s
//! recomputation of `assemble`'s real current output (T5.8 review: previously nothing tied the
//! literal to `assemble`'s actual bytes).
//!
//! ## §18.2: SECRET_MATERIAL never becomes a card
//!
//! [`build_card`] refuses at the top, before touching any other field, to build a card for
//! [`DataClass::SecretMaterial`] input — §18.2: "`data_class=SECRET_MATERIAL` 不生成卡、不进
//! PLATFORM_RETRIEVAL 索引，只走本地 literal lane". [`RetrievalCard::data_class`] is
//! therefore never observed to hold [`DataClass::SecretMaterial`] on any value this module
//! actually constructs — [`CardBuildOutcome::ExcludedSecret`] is the only outcome for that
//! input, carrying no card at all. §18.2 also requires this exclusion be visible, not silent
//! ("并在 §22 的 coverage 里显式扣除并报 `excluded_secret=N`，不许静默少给") — that
//! `excluded_secret=N` is §22.1's `count(*) ... where data_class='SECRET_MATERIAL'` read in the
//! same snapshot as `total`, which is a SQL adapter concern this IO-free crate does not own
//! (§3/§78.3). A prior version of this module carried a `count_excluded_secret` helper here
//! that counted an in-memory `&[CardBuildOutcome]` batch instead — a different population than
//! §22.1's one-query snapshot, unusable by any correct coverage implementation, so it has been
//! removed rather than kept as scaffolding shaped wrong for the interface it named.
//!
//! ## §18.4: card-build failure is a processing gap, not a silent hole
//!
//! §18.4: "禁止「卡失败 ⇒ 记忆静默不可检索」：`projection.retrieval_cards` 缺行必须计入 §15
//! processing gap，并把该查询的 completeness 拉到 `cannot_establish`". [`build_card`] surfaces
//! that failure as [`CardBuildOutcome::Unbuildable`] — the one outcome that, like
//! `ExcludedSecret`, carries no [`RetrievalCard`] to persist. The two are deliberately *not*
//! the same variant: `ExcludedSecret` is a policy exclusion (tracked via `excluded_secret`,
//! §18.2), `Unbuildable` is a processing failure (tracked via `projection::stream`'s existing
//! per-seq gap machinery, §15) — conflating them would make a `SECRET_MATERIAL` memory look
//! like a completeness failure it structurally is not.
//!
//! What "wiring to `projection::stream`'s gap interface" concretely means, and what is out of
//! this task's file scope (reported honestly per this task's own instruction, not forced): a
//! `projection.retrieval_cards` writer that receives [`CardBuildOutcome::Unbuildable`] for a
//! given `stream_seq` must transition that seq's `projection.stream_log` row to `state =
//! 'FAILED'` — the same state transition any other per-seq processing failure already uses
//! (`migrations/0007_projection.sql`'s 9-state `stream_log` CHECK, `projection::stream`'s
//! module doc). That transition alone is sufficient: `projection.processing_gaps` is a *view*
//! over `FAILED`/`LOST` rows (no second gap table to keep in sync, §15.2), and
//! [`crate::stream::advance_prefix`]'s three-way identity already refuses to let a
//! checkpoint's `projection_highwater` cross a `FAILED` seq — see
//! `stream::tests::advance_prefix_stops_at_the_gap_not_past_it` for that behavior against the
//! real function (a prior version of this module carried a same-file test that claimed to
//! demonstrate this but built its `StreamLedgerSnapshot` by hand rather than from a
//! `CardBuildOutcome::Unbuildable`, so it exercised nothing this module's own code produces;
//! removed rather than kept as false coverage, T5.8 review). What this crate does *not*
//! contain — because it does not exist yet
//! anywhere in the workspace, and inventing it here would be exactly the "如实报告不硬凑" this
//! task warns against — is (a) the adapter that actually performs that `UPDATE
//! projection.stream_log SET state = 'FAILED'` write (SQLx-shaped, belongs in
//! `humaux-adapters`, not this IO-free crate) and (b) the `CompletenessClass::CannotEstablish`
//! classifier itself (`projection::stream`'s own module doc already flags this as "out of this
//! task's scope — see `retrieval::completeness`'s module doc", a module that does not exist in
//! this crate). `Unbuildable` is the domain-level signal both of those future pieces consume;
//! no new interface was needed on the `projection::stream` side because a card-build failure
//! is not a new *kind* of gap, it is an ordinary one.
