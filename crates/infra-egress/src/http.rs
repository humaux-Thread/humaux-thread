//! Called-by: [infra-egress::raw, retrieval-provider::adapters]
//! Invariants: [the only holder of a reqwest client for external destinations (built via infra-network, never
//!   Client::new here); non-HTTPS endpoints are refused; provider HTTP statuses map to typed ErrorCodes (401
//!   Unauthorized, 429 RateLimited, 5xx Transient)]
//! Spec: Baseline §7.4; ADR-0003; §19; §7.3; §73.5
//!
//! Raw `reqwest::Client` construction lives one layer down, in `humaux-infra-network` (the
//! sole workspace-wide **protocol** choke point, `xtask architecture-check`'s G80-3 判据1) —
//! this module reaches the `reqwest::Client`/`reqwest::Error` *types* only through
//! `humaux_infra_network::reqwest`, and never calls `Client::new`/`::builder` itself.
//! [`HttpExternalCall`] is this module's one `humaux_domain::egress::ExternalCall`
//! implementation, and the only place in the workspace permitted to hold that client for
//! **external** (cross-trust-boundary, §7.4-disclosed) destinations — same-Cell destinations
//! (Qdrant) go through `humaux-infra-cell`'s `IntraCellHttpTransport` instead (ADR-0003), never
//! through this trait.
//!
//! ## Credential injection (`RetrievalCredentialSource`)
//!
//! [`HttpExternalCall::call`] sends every request with `Content-Type: application/json` (every
//! current/foreseen provider adapter in this workspace speaks JSON, §19 "Provider Plane" own
//! provider-shape survey) and an `Authorization: Bearer <credential>` header, resolved at call
//! time from the [`RetrievalCredentialSource`] this instance was constructed with — never a
//! bare `String` threaded in through a call argument, and never a field on
//! [`AuthorizedEgressPayload`] (§7.3: that type's digest is bound into the `EgressPermit`;
//! folding a credential into it would let a rotated/expired credential silently invalidate a
//! still-valid permit, and would put a secret inside the one struct §7.4's ledger writer reads
//! `payload_bytes`/`payload_sha256` straight off of). [`EgressSecret`] is the one sanctioned
//! carrier for the resolved value between [`RetrievalCredentialSource::credential`] and the
//! `Authorization` header this transport builds from it — see its own doc for why its `Debug`
//! never prints the value, its buffer zeroizes on drop, and (§73.5) why the header value built
//! from it is zeroized and marked sensitive too, not only the wrapper.
//!
//! §19 DOD-028: retrieval instances accept only embedding/rerank permits (POST + Bearer).
//! §71.2: billing instances require explicit GET/POST, auth header and host allowlist;
//! credentials cannot cross between these instance purposes.
//!
//! [`EnvCredentialSource`] is this module's only [`RetrievalCredentialSource`] impl today, and
//! is a **dev/OSS-default implementation, not the production credential path** — see its own
//! doc for the OpenBao upgrade this is standing in for (Baseline_2.9.md "Tenant Data
//! Encryption / Key Hierarchy").
//!
//! A non-2xx response status is classified into an [`ErrorCode`] by the caller-supplied
//! `status_classifier` (see [`HttpExternalCall::new`]) rather than one blanket code — this
//! crate is Layer 1A generic transport and does not itself know a specific provider's or
//! credential-domain's status semantics (e.g. `retrieval-provider::adapters::
//! map_dashscope_status`).
