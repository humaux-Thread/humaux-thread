//! `infra-cell::transport` — ADR-0003 / §83.4 Layer 1B: the same-Cell HTTP capability wrapper.
//! Depends-on: crates=[async-trait, humaux-infra-network, serde_json, tokio, url, uuid]; services=[Qdrant(*)];

//! Invariants: [execute takes a resource-relative path plus a CellAccessPermit, never a URL; paths are validated,
//!   resolved addresses must be in-Cell and not metadata/link-local, redirects are refused; every failure is a typed
//!   IntraCellError]
//! Spec: Baseline §83.4; ADR-0003; ADR-0068 D-E; ADR-0083 D-C
//!
//! [`IntraCellHttpTransport::execute`] takes an [`IntraCellRequest`] (a resource-relative
//! path + optional JSON body) plus a [`CellAccessPermit`], not a bare URL. [`validate_path`]
//! enforces that the relative-path contract actually holds — 判据1 is *not* "already closed by
//! the type signature" the way an earlier version of this doc claimed: `path` is a plain
//! `String` field, and `format!("http://{host}:{port}{path}")` string interpolation (not a URL
//! parser) is what turns it into the dialed address, so a path like `@evil.example.com/steal`
//! would otherwise rewrite the URL's authority entirely, landing the connection on a host that
//! was never DNS-resolved or CIDR-checked at all.
//!
//! **§83.4 判据3, single-resolver fix (ADR-0003 second round; OWASP SSRF Cheat Sheet: DNS
//! rebinding / check-then-use DNS pinning bypass) for a *hostname* authority.** An earlier
//! version of this file resolved `entry.host()` itself via `self.dns.resolve(...)`, validated
//! the result, and *then* handed the bare hostname string to `reqwest` — which resolves the
//! name a second time, inside its own connector, with no guarantee the second lookup returns
//! what the first one validated. [`ValidatingResolver`] closes that gap by construction rather
//! than by discipline: it implements `reqwest::dns::Resolve`
//! (`humaux_infra_network::http::build_client_with_resolver`, stable in reqwest 0.12.28) and
//! *is* the client's DNS resolver, so there is exactly one lookup per connection attempt *for a
//! name host*, and the CIDR/metadata judgment runs inside that single lookup, before `reqwest`
//! ever receives an address to dial.
//!
//! **This does not cover an IP-literal `entry.host()`, which is the common case in this tree's
//! own tests and every real registry construction site today.** `reqwest`/`hyper`'s connector
//! never calls a custom `dns_resolver` at all when the URL authority is (or WHATWG-normalizes
//! to) an IP literal — it parses and dials such an address directly, so [`ValidatingResolver`]
//! is never consulted for it (this was a real regression the second round introduced: the
//! first round's manual `self.dns.resolve(entry.host())` pre-check ran unconditionally, and
//! `ToSocketAddrs` happened to handle an IP-literal host too). [`HttpIntraCellTransport::execute`]
//! therefore re-derives the exact address `reqwest` is about to dial via `url::Url::parse` (the
//! same WHATWG host-parsing `reqwest` itself runs) *before* `send()`, and applies the identical
//! metadata/link-local-then-CIDR judgment there for a `Host::Ipv4`/`Host::Ipv6` result — a
//! `Host::Domain` result is left to [`ValidatingResolver`], run unconditionally when `send()`
//! actually resolves it. The unconditional hard block on the cloud-metadata address
//! `169.254.169.254` and any other link-local address runs first, before the registry's CIDR
//! allowlist, in both paths, so a misconfigured registry entry cannot accidentally widen that
//! one address back in. A rejected hostname resolution surfaces to the connector as a boxed
//! [`IntraCellError`]; `execute` walks the resulting `reqwest::Error`'s source chain
//! ([`downcast_intra_cell_error`]) to recover the original typed variant instead of flattening
//! it to a generic connect-failure string — the IP-literal pre-check instead returns its typed
//! error directly, having never called `send()` at all. TLS certificate validation still runs
//! against the original hostname (SNI/SAN) — this intercepts address *resolution* only, never
//! makes the client dial a bare IP with hostname verification skipped. A 3xx response is never
//! followed to a second, unchecked host either
//! (`humaux_infra_network::http::build_client_with_resolver` disables `reqwest`'s
//! redirect-following entirely; a 3xx status is surfaced here as
//! [`IntraCellError::UnexpectedRedirect`] instead of a followed connection).
//!
//! §83.4 判据4/5 (deploy-gate: no Internet/NAT route out of the Cell, mTLS/TLS-SAN identity
//! pinning) remain deploy-gate concerns (README "Intra-cell network deploy gate"), not
//! re-derived here — this crate's code-level judgment covers 判据1/2/3/6.
