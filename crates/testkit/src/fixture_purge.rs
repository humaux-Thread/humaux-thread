//! `testkit::fixture_purge` — the one teardown of a fixture tenant, and the catalog-driven integrity edges
//!   it and the dev orphan scan share.
//! Depends-on: crates=[]; services=[PostgreSQL(any) w=[control.tenants]]; env=[]; modules=[]
//! Called-by: [tests, xtask::e2e_seed]
//! Invariants: [test infrastructure only, never a runtime path (callers: `e2e-seed --teardown`, the switch_visible and
//!   derived_dispatch_e2e fixtures); the purge names no table: rows are reached through
//!   tenant_id columns, pg_constraint and the ADR-0063 D-B identity rule at run time; a tenant that fails the fixture
//!   predicate, or whose closure reaches another tenant's rows, raises and nothing is purged]
//! Spec: §79.2; ADR-0063 ("Dev integrity finding", D-B)
//!
//! Text builders only (nothing here opens a connection, although the crate depends on `postgres` for `disposable`): the
//! caller runs the text on its own `postgres` connection — `client.batch_execute(&purge_tenant_fixture_sql(&tenant_id.to_string())?)`.

/// The integrity-edge generator (`sql/integrity_edges.sql`): one row per FK (per-leaf clones flagged `inherited`)
/// and per ADR-0063 D-B identity table, with the statement that counts (`scan_sql`) and deletes (`delete_sql`) the
/// rows violating it. Wrap it as a subquery (`select scan_sql from (…) g`); the dev orphan gate
/// (`c36_dev_orphan_repair.sh scan`) reads the same file.

/// starts `humaux_thread_`, the binding rule `e2e-seed` applies to its DSN) AND the tenant's name starts with

///
/// 1. Refuses unless the tenant exists and passes the fixture predicate ([`FIXTURE_TENANT_PREFIX`]).
/// 2. `SET LOCAL session_replication_role = replica`: the only way past the append-only guards (0128 and the §77
///    audit guard) for test residue. It also skips RI and the ADR-0063 identity release triggers, which is why the
///    rest of this statement must leave no row behind that a trigger or an FK would have handled.
/// 3. Marks, to a fixpoint: every row of every table with a `tenant_id` column equal to the tenant, then every row
///    that references a marked row through any FK (`pg_constraint`, any arity, MATCH SIMPLE) or is the identity row
///    of a marked partitioned-parent row. Refuses if a marked row carries another tenant's id.
/// 4. Deletes children first, by FK depth over the marked tables; then the identity tables (the rows their release
///    triggers would have removed); then the tenant row; then drops its scratch temp tables and restores the caller's
///    replication role — so any number of purges can run in one transaction.
///
/// Refusals the caller must design for (each raises, rolls the statement back and purges nothing):
/// - **Decoys first.** A tenant whose closure reaches another tenant's rows is refused with both tenant ids and the
///   relation (`tenant A reaches rows of tenant B through …`). A test that made tenant A's rows reference a decoy
///   tenant B purges B (the referencing side's dependents) in the order that leaves no cross-tenant edge, or purges
///   both in one transaction in that order.
/// - **No concurrent DDL on `tenant_id` tables.** The purge reads the catalog when it runs; a table dropped by another
///   session meanwhile is refused as `relation … vanished while the purge ran`. A caller whose sibling tests create
///   and drop `tenant_id` tables holds the advisory lock those tests take around their DDL for the purge (the 0137
///   cleanup holds its guards' DDL lock).
