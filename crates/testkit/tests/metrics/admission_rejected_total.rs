// witness: family=admission_rejected_total labels=class,reason
//! `testkit::tests::metrics::admission_rejected_total` — Metric Witness for `admission_rejected_total{class,reason}`
//!   (§80.2 W-side; registry row §41.2 「§67 admission control 返 503 处 · 1」; consumer §42 AdmissionRejected).
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-telemetry]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[telemetry::admission]
//! Called-by: []
//! Invariants: [drives the family's one emit (`telemetry::admission::count_admission_rejected`, called once per 503 by
//!   `gateway::admission`) and asserts the exact per-reason delta and the rendered label set, never mere presence]
//! Spec: Baseline §41.2; §42; §67.2; §80.2; ADR-0061 D-A; ADR-0065 D-C
//!
//! The encoder seeds every reason at 0 (ADR-0061 D-A), so presence proves nothing: this asserts the increment. The
//! 503 path itself is proven by `gateway::admission::tests` (one rejection per refused request). Compiled and run
//! standalone by `cargo xtask metrics-registry` (`run_witness_probe`).
