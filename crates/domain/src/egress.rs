//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: Baseline §7; §7.0; §7.2; ADR-0003
//!
//! §7.0's frozen判定线: "未经 `EgressPermit` 且未记账的出境 = 违规". §7.3 makes that a
//! *topology*, not a discipline: `EgressPermit`'s fields are all private and it has no `pub`
//! constructor, `Default`, `Clone`, or `Deserialize` — the only way any code, anywhere in the
//! workspace, can obtain one is [`authorize`], the sole `pub` entry point in this module. A
//! struct literal `EgressPermit { .. }` outside this file does not compile (private fields);
//! [`EgressPermit::issue`] itself is not even `pub(crate)` so that no *other* module inside
//! this crate can mint one either — [`authorize`] is the single caller, enforced by ordinary
//! Rust privacy rather than convention (repo CLAUDE.md 铁律: "把纪律换成拓扑").
//!
//! §83.4 additionally closes the transport side: [`OutboundPurpose`]'s variant set is the
//! `external-egress-registry` fenced block's first column, spelled identically (SCREAMING_SNAKE
//! variant idents, `#[allow(non_camel_case_types)]`) so `xtask architecture-check`'s G80-3 set
//! comparison needs no case-folding step to drift out of sync with the registry text it quotes.
//! Its three `private-data` variants (`USER_REASONING` / `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING` /
//! `RETRIEVAL_RERANK`) each carry an owned [`EgressPermit`] — the registry's "必须类型化携带
//! EgressPermit" requirement becomes "there is no `OutboundPurpose::USER_REASONING` value that
//! does not already contain one", checked by the compiler, not by a runtime assertion.
//!
//! §7.5.1's fail-closed rule now has one executable checkpoint: [`authorize`] refuses to mint
//! a permit for a `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING`/`RETRIEVAL_RERANK` purpose whose caller-supplied
//! [`DataClass`] is [`DataClass::SecretMaterial`] — §7.5's "SECRET_MATERIAL 的 Card/Query 不得
//! 进入外部 embedding/rerank" line, made structural rather than a discipline every retrieval
//! caller has to remember. `USER_REASONING` carries no such per-purpose ceiling (§7.5 only
//! names the two retrieval purposes), so [`authorize`] leaves it unrestricted by `data_class`.
//!
//! Deliberately out of this module's scope (later tasks, tracked so nothing here silently
//! forecloses them):
//! - §83.4's `NetworkPermit` (a thinner wrapper `ExternalHttpTransport::execute` would take)
//!   is not introduced: this task's own scope names `ExternalCall`'s signature as
//!   `(EgressPermit, AuthorizedEgressPayload)` directly, and folding the private-data purposes'
//!   permit straight into [`OutboundPurpose`] gives the identical compile-time guarantee with
//!   one fewer type. Add `NetworkPermit` only if a non-private-data `OutboundPurpose` variant
//!   later needs its own permit shape that isn't `EgressPermit`.
//! - The Processor Registry (`control.processors` et al., §7 末) — the DB-backed table that
//!   would resolve a real `ProcessorId` — belongs to a later task; [`ProcessorId`] here is a
//!   minimal local newtype, not that eventual identifier.
//! - §7.2's *tenant-level* switch (`control.egress_policies.private_retrieval_external_allowed`,
//!   `migrations/0051_egress_policies.sql`) is **not** consulted by [`authorize`] — the table
//!   exists, but nothing in this module reads it yet. A caller must check it itself before
//!   calling `authorize` for a retrieval purpose. Similarly, [`authorize`] does not reserve an
//!   `ops.data_disclosures` row (§7.4) — `humaux_adapters::disclosure::reserve_private`/
//!   `reserve_retrieval` already exist and read `permit.data_class()`/`permit.purpose()`
//!   directly, but the caller must sequence `authorize` → `reserve` → [`ExternalCall::call`] →
//!   `finalize` itself; nothing here enforces that ordering. §7.0's judgment line is therefore
//!   only half-closed by this module: the *topology* (nobody mints a permit except here, and a
//!   `SECRET_MATERIAL` retrieval permit cannot be minted at all) is real, but "was this tenant
//!   allowed to egress at all" and "was this call recorded" remain caller discipline, not
//!   compiler-enforced facts, until a later task threads them through here.
