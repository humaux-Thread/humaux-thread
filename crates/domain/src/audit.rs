//! `domain::audit` — §77 双轨审计: `AuditEvent` minimal field set, the `AuditMetadata` allowlist type,
//!   `SensitiveAdminAction`, the closed `McpAuditAction` set, and the `AuditBatch` hash-chain (construction +
//!   verification only — no IO, no ObjectStore; the adapter-layer export port lives in `adapters::audit_sink`,
//!   §3/§78.3 keeps this crate free of it).
//! Depends-on: crates=[sha2, uuid]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[domain::error, domain::ids]
//! Called-by: [adapters::audit_sink, adapters::confirm_token_repo, adapters::context_repo, adapters::distill_repo, adapters::maintenance_repo, adapters::memory_governance_repo, adapters::operation_receipt, adapters::provisioning, adapters::quota_repo, adapters::request_guard_repo, application::auth, gateway::guard, gateway::mcp_application, tests]
//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: Baseline §77
//!
//! §77 draws three log kinds apart (Application Logs / Security Audit Events / Financial
//! Ledger) and, within Security Audit, two further layers: **Operational Audit** (PostgreSQL
//! append-only application contract — `control.audit_events`, `migrations/0034_audit.sql`'s
//! `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger) and the **Immutable Audit Sink** (periodic
//! hash-chained batch export to WORM/immutable object storage — this module's [`AuditBatch`]
//! / [`batch_hash`] / [`verify_chain`]). The two-layer split exists because §77 states
//! plainly that the operational table "仍可被高权限管理员修改" — the Rust-level append-only
//! contract and the DB trigger are both defense in depth, not the tamper-evidence guarantee
//! itself; that guarantee is the exported hash chain.
