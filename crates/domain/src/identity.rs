//! Invariants: []

//!
//! §6.1.1 freezes: tenant isolation (PostgreSQL RLS, `SET LOCAL humaux.tenant_id/user_id`,
//! §6.1/§62) is not the end of multi-user isolation — inside one tenant, three visibility
//! classes exist (`USER_PRIVATE`/`WORKSPACE_SHARED`/`TENANT_SHARED`), and exactly one
//! function in the whole workspace decides whether a scope can see an object of a given
//! class: [`can_read`]. Every read-time adapter (PG RLS/SQL, Qdrant payload filter,
//! Object/Artifact authorization, Graph/Code association expansion) must route through the
//! same predicate — "业务 Adapter 不允许各自维护一套'差不多相同'的可见性条件" — so this
//! module is that predicate's one home, not a template each adapter re-derives.
//!
//! `can_read` alone is not a complete read-time filter: per §6.1.2 the real predicate is
//! `tenant filter AND authorized visibility disjunction AND query-specific narrower filters`,
//! and `can_read` implements only the middle term. Every caller must independently AND in its
//! own tenant-equality filter — see [`can_read`]'s doc for why.
//!
//! `AuthorizationScope`'s fields are private by design: the spec's own words are "请求得到
//! 一个不可由模型构造的" `AuthorizationScope` — the LLM/tool-call layer never builds one
//! directly, only the trusted authentication/authorization layer does, through [`AuthorizationScope::new`].
//! From there, an MCP tool argument may only reach [`AuthorizationScope::narrow`], which can
//! shrink the scope but is structurally unable to grow it (§6.1.1: "workspace_id、user_id
//! 若来自 MCP Tool 参数，只能进一步缩小 Auth Scope，绝不能扩大它").
