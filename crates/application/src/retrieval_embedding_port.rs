//! `application::retrieval_embedding_port` — ADR-0012's sole cross-process boundary type the Gateway depends on for
//!   query embedding.
//! Depends-on: crates=[async-trait, humaux-domain, uuid]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[domain::error,
//!   domain::identity, domain::ids]
//! Called-by: [gateway::bootstrap, gateway::cached_embedding, gateway::recall, gateway::retrieval_embedding_client, tests]
//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: ADR-0012; §4.2; §2
//!
//! §4.2 keeps `role_gateway`/`bins/gateway` free of the PLATFORM_RETRIEVAL provider credential
//! and the `role_retrieval_worker` DB pool (both live only behind
//! `humaux_retrieval_provider::adapters::DashscopeEmbeddingProvider`, worker-side). This trait
//! is the narrow seam `bins/gateway/src/recall.rs` calls instead of
//! `humaux_retrieval_provider::contract::EmbeddingProvider` directly — a real implementation
//! (`bins/gateway/src/retrieval_embedding_client.rs`) registers a call row via `RuntimeDbPool`
//! and RPCs `humaux-retrieval-worker` over the ADR-0012 Unix domain socket; the worker alone
//! calls the real `EmbeddingProvider`.
//!
//! Deliberately carries only what ADR-0012 §2 says crosses the wire in each direction: raw
//! query text and routing/identity metadata out, a vector plus non-secret model-stamp fields
//! back. Never: `AuthorizationScope` itself, a sealed query, a provider credential, or an
//! `EgressPermit` — those stay inside the worker process that already owns them.
