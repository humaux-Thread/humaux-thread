//! `telemetry::direction` — §53.6 direction table: hand-written data checked for parity against its own generation
//!   source by `cargo xtask direction-table` (G80-9).
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-fail-closed-macro]; services=[]; env=[]; modules=[humaux-fail-closed-macro]
//! Called-by: []
//! Invariants: []
//! Spec: Baseline §53.2; §53.3; §53.4
//!
//! "由代码生成
//! 而非手写" (§53.6) means this const is the *reference* copy, not the source of truth —
//! `cargo xtask direction-table` regenerates the same shape from `degrade::DegradeCode`
//! (fail-open side) and every `#[fail_closed(threat = "...")]`-annotated function in the
//! workspace (fail-closed side) and diffs the two; a mismatch is red (G80-9, §80.1.1).
//!
//! Row shape is `subject + direction`, not the full `operation | failure | policy |
//! fallback | degrade_code | fault_test` schema §53.6 sketches as an example — this table's
//! only job is proving fail-open/fail-closed completeness, and §53.4 / §53.3 规则2 already
//! own the fault_test/degrade_code parity separately. Widening this table's row shape into
//! a second copy of that parity was already rejected for this table's fields (fault +
//! direction only, no fault-injection columns) — reuse the annotation + injection-test
//! mechanism for anything without a fault, don't extend the table.
