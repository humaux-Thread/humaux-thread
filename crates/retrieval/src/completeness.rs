//! `retrieval::completeness` — `LedgerCounts` / `CompletenessClass` / `FreshnessClass` / the `ledger::close` and
//!   `classify()` sole constructors (§22.4 / §22.5 / §59).
//! Depends-on: crates=[humaux-domain, humaux-telemetry, serde]; services=[];
//!   env=[]; modules=[domain::context, domain::ledger, retrieval::envelope, retrieval::planner, retrieval::request, telemetry::metrics]
//! Called-by: [adapters::context_repo, adapters::exact_census, adapters::read_gate, adapters::retrieve, adapters::serving_repo, adapters::stream_repo, gateway::context, gateway::memory, gateway::recall, gateway::status, retrieval::envelope, retrieval::signals, tests]
//! Invariants: [ledger::close is the sole LedgerClosure constructor; A1 counts tickets, A2's PostgreSQL side
//!   (ProjectionReads) counts memory points (ADR-0057 D-A); classify has six inputs and LedgerClosure::lagging
//!   is the only projection-lag comparison (ADR-0057 D-D/D-E); record_final_classification holds the one increment of
//!   retrieval_completeness_total and of humaux_retrieval_requests_total; render_metrics seeds both over closed sets]
//! Spec: §22.4; §22.5; §59; §41.2; §25.3; §78.2; ADR-0057; ADR-0061 D-A; ADR-0061 D-C
//!
//! `classify()` is the sole constructor of [`CompletenessClass`]; final outcome emission is
//! the sole increment point of `retrieval_completeness_total{class,reason}` (§22.5, §41.2).
//! Its
//! parameters are `planner_output` / `lane_status` / `census_result` / `ledger` /
//! `mandatory_missing` / `lag_threshold` — §22.5's four plus the §25.3 Mandatory shortfall added by
//! card 22c's review (an unmet obligation moves `completeness`, see
//! [`CannotEstablishReason::MandatoryNotSatisfied`]) and the §22.4 projection-lag threshold
//! (ADR-0057 D-E, which closes ADR-0047's parameter-count debt); this module reuses [`crate::planner::PlannerDecision`] for
//! `planner_output` and [`crate::envelope::LaneStatus`] for `lane_status` rather than
//! inventing second representations of either — only `CensusResult` is minted here, because
//! no Authority-census type exists anywhere in the workspace yet (see its own doc for scope).
//!
//! Note: the exhaustiveness test at the bottom of this file pins variant *count and shape*,
//! not the verbatim wire name of each variant. Verbatim string pinning is deferred to the
//! §78.2 DB↔Rust contract-test card, not covered here.
//!
//! Spec adjudications (recorded here so a later wave does not flip them back):
//! 1. Visibility: §59's code block writes `pub enum CompletenessClass`; §22.5 freezes it as
//!    private, produced only by the sole constructor `classify()`. §22 is the home chapter
//!    for the Completeness Contract, so per CLAUDE.md ("on conflict with spec, the spec's own
//!    home chapter wins") §22.5 wins — `CompletenessClass` is `pub(crate)` here.
//!    `FreshnessClass` has no such rule (§21.5 imposes no privacy constraint) and stays `pub`.
//! 2. Shape: §22.5 freezes `CannotEstablish` as `CannotEstablish { reason: "ledger_not_closed" }`
//!    — a reason field. §78.2 bans stringly-typed domain, so `reason` here is a closed enum
//!    ([`CannotEstablishReason`]), not a loose `&'static str`.
//! 3. G80-6 witness reachability: `classify()` must stay `pub(crate)` (adjudication 1), but
//!    §80.1 G80-6's component witness harness runs from `crates/testkit` — a different crate —
//!    and can only call `pub` entry points. [`classify_for_witness`] calls `classify()` verbatim
//!    and returns only its wire label pair, never the `CompletenessClass` value (a `pub` fn
//!    cannot name a `pub(crate)` return type anyway). It is label-only: the actual final metric
//!    remains reachable solely through `envelope_outcome_block` after full Envelope validation.
//! 4. `PlannerDecision::Class(_)` (every §20 wire class except `DirectGet`/`Enumerate`,
//!    including `State` — §22.2 FACET_COMPLETE's natural source) maps to `SemanticBounded`,
//!    not `FacetComplete`: the signature carries no `covered_facets` /
//!    `required_facets` count, so claiming `FacetComplete` here would be an unproven
//!    completeness claim (§22.0's "no verbal EXACT claim" invariant, generalized).
//!    `FacetComplete` stays a real, constructible variant (exercised directly by this file's
//!    own exhaustiveness test) — just not reachable through `classify()` until a later wave
//!    threads facet-coverage counts into the signature.
// ponytail: adjudication 4's gap — `classify()` never emits `FacetComplete` today. Upgrade
// path: add a facet-coverage input (covered/required counts) to `classify()`'s signature and
// give `PlannerDecision::Class(QueryClass::State)` its own arm once that lands.
