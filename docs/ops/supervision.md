# Supervision runbook — the resident units

> Scope: §4.2's minimal process set, §4.4's probe contract, ADR-0037. This file is the
> operational half of card 15; the architectural decisions and their limits are in
> `docs/adr/0037-liveness-readiness-and-supervision.md`. Spec § numbers are references, never
> copies — judgement text lives in `docs/architecture/Baseline_2.9.md`.

**Environment variables.** This runbook does not list them. The one complete list is
[`docs/architecture/env_vars.md`](../architecture/env_vars.md), generated from the code by
`cargo xtask dep-map --write`. It covers every variable, which process and module reads it, and
whether the typed registry declares it. `cargo xtask dep-map --check` fails when the list and the
code drift apart. Look a variable up there rather than copying it here. The same run generates, per deployed
process, the key list a node must fill — `deploy/env/example/<process>.env` (every runtime key of that process,
secret keys marked with the `<process>.secret.env` they belong in; dev-only keys such as the `*_ALLOW_SAME_UID`
pair are never listed) — and the empty-valued placeholder secrets under `deploy/env/secret-fixture/` (ADR-0066
D-T, D-J); `deploy-check --env` compares a node's values and secret files against those lists. One gateway fact that
list cannot show: since card 29 (ADR-0054) the gateway needs **no default write pair** — every
write derives (tenant, workspace) per request, and the two `REMEMBER_TENANT_ID` /
`REMEMBER_WORKSPACE_ID` keys are accepted-and-ignored (e2e tooling only).

## 1. The processes and resident units, and how each answers "are you up"

| process | liveness | readiness | resident? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `humaux-gateway` | `GET /livez` → 200 | `GET /readyz` → 200 / 503 | yes (HTTP accept loop) |
| `humaux-retrieval-worker` | process alive | `--readyz` exit 0 | `--serve-rpc` yes; `--serve` yes (the projection runner, ADR-0052); `--run-once` no |
| `humaux-private-worker` | process alive | `--readyz` exit 0 | `--serve-rpc` / `--distill-serve` yes |
| `humaux-consolidation-worker` | process alive | `--readyz` exit 0 | `--serve` yes |
| `humaux-public-worker` | process alive | `--readyz` exit 0 | no — one bounded pass per invocation |
| `humaux-maintenance` | `health serve`: process alive | `health serve`: `GET /metrics` on its ops address → 200 / 503 | `health serve` yes (card 34, ADR-0061 D-D); every other subcommand no (card 28) |
| `humaux-maintenance --serve` | process alive | `GET /metrics` on `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` → 200 / 503 | yes — the sixth resident unit (card 35, ADR-0062 D-A): the scheduled maintenance daemon |
| `humaux-maintenance retention …` | — | — | **never** — one-shot operator commands with the superuser migrator DSN (card 36, ADR-0063 D-H); never supervised |
| `humaux-maintenance backup …`, `restore drill`, `restore pitr`, `projection rebuild \| verify` | — | — | **never** — one-shot (card 37, ADR-0064 D-I): `backup run` and `restore drill` from the host crontab through `deploy/pgbackrest/humaux-dr.sh` (0600 `dr.env`), the rest by the operator; they need the docker CLI (root-equivalent), so neither the docker socket nor `dr.env` ever enters the supervised environment. In the container bundle (ADR-0066 D-H) they run on the `dr` one-shot (`deploy/release/compose.sh run --rm -T dr …`, profile `ops`), the crontab calls the same wrapper, and no resident service holds the socket |

`humaux-maintenance --serve` (ADR-0062) is the scheduled maintenance daemon and the eighth ops pair
(`humaux-maintenance:serve`, ADR-0061 D-B): every
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_CYCLE_SECONDS` it runs each due task of the closed D-C list (LOST sweep, quota and
provider-budget reapers, the four purge doors, the Q-drain reissue and the schema-failed re-drive) over one page
of tenants, one transaction and one door call per tenant, as `role_maintenance`. Every key is required with no
default (runbook "Scheduled maintenance" has the table). Only the first connect is boot-fatal; a failed call is
logged, counted (`maintenance_task_runs_total{outcome="failed"}`) and answered 503 while the loop goes on, so do
not restart it on a 503. `/metrics` answers 200 with the two D-S counters only while the last finished cycle had no
failed call and a cycle finished within 3 × CYCLE; `/status` carries `cycles`, `in_cycle` and `last_cycle` per
task. SIGTERM / Ctrl-C is checked between door calls, so a stop never waits out a cycle. **Run exactly one
instance**: a second one only doubles the calls (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` keeps the results correct), and both must
read one env file, because the daemon reads the gateway's `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_PROJECTION_LAG_SECONDS` and the distill
worker's `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_DISTILL_BUDGET_WINDOW_SECS` under their own names (ADR-0062 L4). It never samples
health and `health serve` never purges (ADR-0062 D-A).

Since card 37 (ADR-0064 D-K) the daemon also runs the cluster-level `dr_evidence` task, so its supervised
environment carries three more required keys (no default; not secrets): `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_DR_EVIDENCE_EVERY_SECONDS`,
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_DR_REPO_FS_PATH` (the backup filesystem's mount point, e.g. `/srv/humaux/pgbackrest`) and
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_DR_PGDATA_FS_PATH` (the filesystem holding Docker's data root, `/` on a single-disk host); it
reads statvfs(3) of the two paths in-process (f_bavail × f_frsize; no `df` child) and reads the backup and drill
receipts. It needs no budget key, no docker access and
no cipher pass: the backup, `restore drill` and `restore pitr` arms are one-shot (row above, runbook §11) and the
daemon only reports what their receipts recorded.

Since card W0 (ADR-0072) it also runs the per-tenant `quota_renewal` task, with four more required keys (no default;
not secrets): `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_QUOTA_RENEWAL_EVERY_SECONDS`, `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_QUOTA_RENEWAL_LIMIT`,
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_QUOTA_RENEWAL_LEAD_SECONDS` and `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_QUOTA_RENEWAL_SUBSCRIPTION_MONTHS`
(bundle values in `deploy/env/values/maintenance.env`). A daemon that is down past a tenant's period end leaves that
tenant on ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED until it runs again; `QuotaWindowRenewalMissing` fires a week before that.

`humaux-maintenance health serve` (ADR-0061 D-D) **is** a supervised unit: the one process that samples
the §41.2 SQL-derived health gauges (`jobs_*`, `oldest_pending_age_seconds`, `projection_lag_events`,
`processing_gap_count`, `data_disclosures_*`, and the two tenant counts `tenants_active_1d` /
`tenants_active_7d` — distinct ACTIVE tenants with an API key used in the last 24 h / 168 h, an exact
count so 0 is a real value) through `ops.health_snapshot()` as `role_maintenance`, plus the three host
gauges from `/proc` (`host_pressure_ratio{resource,kind}` = PSI `avg60 / 100` for `resource` =
`cpu` / `memory` / `io` and `kind` = `some` / `full`; `host_memory_available_bytes` = `MemAvailable` in
bytes; `host_cpu_busy_ratio` = the busy share of the delta between two `/proc/stat` samples), every
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_HEALTH_SAMPLE_SECONDS`, and serves the last sample on the loopback
`HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_HEALTH_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` (`/metrics`, `/status`). Both keys are required, with no
default. The first sample is taken before the port binds, so a boot that cannot sample exits non-zero
naming the failure. A scrape never runs SQL. A failed sample, or one older than 2 × the interval, makes
`/metrics` answer 503 with the reason and the age — never the last good values. Run exactly one
instance: two would export every gauge twice.

The three host gauges are **absent, never 0**, while their `/proc` source is unreadable: nothing renders
before the first host sample, `host_cpu_busy_ratio` also has no series on that first tick (it needs two
readable samples), and on a host without `/proc` (the macOS rehearsal) a live scrape may carry none of
them (#207, `ABSENT_WITHOUT_PROC`). A missing or malformed PSI line, `/proc/meminfo` or `/proc/stat`
leaves its series out rather than writing 0 (§4.4: "not scanned" is not "none").

### Ops listeners: `/metrics` and `/status` (card 34, ADR-0061 D-B)

Every resident mode opens one **loopback** ops listener on its own required key — one key per
mode, never per binary, because two modes of one binary run at the same time from one environment.
It serves `GET /metrics` (Prometheus text format 0.0.4, every label value pre-seeded at 0 so the
first scrape already has a sample per family) and `GET /status` (JSON: `process`, `mode`,
`crate_version`, `git_sha`, `started_at`, `uptime_seconds`, the 11 `degrade` codes with their count
and `last_fired_at`; the gateway adds `accepting`, `readiness` and `effective_config`, where a
secret entry carries `secret: true` and never a value). A non-loopback or missing address is
boot-fatal naming the key; there is no default port and no fallback to `:0`. One-shot modes
(`--readyz`, `--run-once`, `--distill-once`, every other maintenance subcommand) open nothing.

| process / mode | ops key | families on `/metrics` |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_METRICS_ADDR` | 9: `degrade_total`, `humaux_retrieval_requests_total`, `retrieval_completeness_total`, the six guard families |
| retrieval-worker `--serve-rpc` | `HUMAUX_RETRIEVAL_WORKER_SERVE_RPC_METRICS_ADDR` | 4 `retrieval_provider_*` |
| retrieval-worker `--serve` | `HUMAUX_RETRIEVAL_WORKER_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` | 4 `retrieval_provider_*` |
| private-worker `--serve-rpc` | `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_SERVE_RPC_METRICS_ADDR` | none yet (card 34b) — `up` is its liveness |
| private-worker `--distill-serve` | `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_DISTILL_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` | none yet (card 34b) |
| consolidation-worker `--serve` | `HUMAUX_CONSOLIDATION_WORKER_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` | none yet (card 34b) |
| maintenance `health serve` | `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_HEALTH_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` | 14: 11 SQL-derived health families (`jobs_*`, `oldest_pending_age_seconds`, `projection_lag_events`, `processing_gap_count`, `data_disclosures_*`, `tenants_active_1d`, `tenants_active_7d`) + 3 host gauges (`host_pressure_ratio`, `host_memory_available_bytes`, `host_cpu_busy_ratio`) |
| maintenance `--serve` | `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_METRICS_ADDR` | 2: `maintenance_task_runs_total{task,outcome}`, `maintenance_task_rows_total{task}` (ADR-0062 D-S; zero state: `--serve --metrics-families`) |

`/metrics` and `/status` are **never** on the gateway's `BIND_ADDR` (the MCP surface behind the
reverse proxy): anything mounted there is reachable through the proxy. `BIND_ADDR` keeps `/livez`
and `/readyz`, whose body is a status word only. Each binary prints its zero-state exposition with
`--metrics-families` before reading any configuration; `cargo xtask metrics-registry --check` uses
exactly that to prove every exported family is a §41.2 row.

### The gateway's `/readyz` is dependency-truthful (ADR-0061 D-F, ruling E15)

A background task refreshes a readiness snapshot every `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_READINESS_REFRESH_SECONDS`
(required, > 0); the first snapshot is taken before the listener accepts. Each check is bounded by
that interval: `pg` (`SELECT 1` as `role_gateway`), `retrieval_rpc` (a real
`GET /internal/v1/retrieval/readyz` round trip over the recall socket; the worker answers from one
fresh `role_retrieval_worker` connection and never calls the embedding provider) and `qdrant`
(the gateway's own Qdrant cell resource). With semantic recall disabled the last two are
`not_applicable`. `/readyz` answers 200 `{"status":"ready"}` only while the gateway accepts, every
dependency is `pass` or `not_applicable` and the snapshot is at most 2 × the interval old;
otherwise 503 with `{"status":"not_ready"}`, `{"status":"stale"}` or `{"status":"draining"}`. The
body never names a dependency, a path or an error — those are in the loopback `/status`
(`readiness`: per dependency `state`, `checked_at`, `age_seconds`, `missing_object`). Probe
`/readyz` no faster than the refresh interval buys you nothing: a probe reads the cached snapshot.

Every other `humaux-maintenance` subcommand (§4.2, the operator-write process) is not supervised: every subcommand
(`deploy-init`, `onboard tenant|workspace|user`, `apikey issue|revoke`, `placement ensure`,
`collection ensure`, `activate`, `status`) is one-shot, idempotent and prints one JSON receipt;
exit `0` created/existing, `3` refused with a named reason, `2` usage, `1` infrastructure (the
database or Qdrant it names is down — retry once it is up; a re-run never duplicates a row).
It runs as its own OS user with `role_maintenance`'s DSN and the credential pepper, which no
resident process except the gateway holds. Operating it: `docs/ops/runbook.md` §3 and §6.

**The `retention …` arms are never supervised and never resident** (card 36, ADR-0063 D-H):
`humaux-maintenance retention approve | create-partitions | execute` each open the **superuser** migrator principal
`HUMAUX_MIGRATOR_PG_DSN` for one transaction and exit. They run from the operator's shell only, with that key
exported for the one command (runbook §5.3 monthly `create-partitions`, §5.4 retention execute); no scheduler, cron
entry or unit stores it. The supervised environment must **not** define `HUMAUX_MIGRATOR_PG_DSN`: both resident
modes (`humaux-maintenance --serve` and `humaux-maintenance health serve`) check for the key by name as their first
statement and exit 2 with `boot refused: HUMAUX_MIGRATOR_PG_DSN is set in a resident mode's environment (ADR-0063 D-H)`
when it is present at all, even empty — before reading any other key or binding a port. Because both modes and the
operator commands of one binary share one env file (above), keep the migrator DSN out of that file; a boot loop
with this line means it is there.

The four workers have no HTTP surface, so their readiness is an **exec probe**: run the binary
with `--readyz`, exit 0 = ready. It performs one live round trip per dependency and exits; it
claims nothing, writes nothing, and spends no provider call.

### What each `--readyz` actually touches

| process | dependencies probed | deliberately NOT probed |
|---|---|---|
| retrieval-worker | `role_retrieval_worker` connect + `current_user` (§6.2.3 assertion E); Qdrant cell resource answers a real HTTP GET through the same registry/permit/transport the projection path uses | its own RPC socket (it is that socket's server) |
| private-worker | `role_private_worker` connect + `current_user` | the BYOK provider endpoint — a readiness poll must not spend an inference call; its own RPC socket, same reason as above |
| consolidation-worker | `role_consolidation_worker` connect + `current_user`; the private worker's UDS peer accepts a connection | `ops.claim_derived_work` — it is a SECURITY DEFINER **write** (migration 0164); calling it as a probe would take a real job off the queue and hand it to a process about to exit |
| public-worker | `role_public_worker` connect + `current_user`; Qdrant cell resource answers a real HTTP GET | `ops.outbox` claim — same reason |

A `--readyz` failure prints `not ready — missing object: <the thing that is down>` on stderr and
exits non-zero. **The object is always named.** A probe that cannot reach its dependency must
never report a healthy-but-empty reading — §4.4 坑5, "没有" ≠ "没扫到".

## 2. What a failed probe means, and what to do

| symptom | means | action |
|---|---|---|
| `/livez` connection refused | the gateway process is gone or never bound | restart; check bootstrap stderr for the missing configuration key. A default write pair is **not** one of them since card 29 (ADR-0054): `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_REMEMBER_TENANT_ID` / `_WORKSPACE_ID` are optional and ignored (a present value must still be a UUID — a malformed one is the only way they fail boot) |
| `/readyz` → 503 `draining` | SIGTERM was received; the process is finishing in-flight requests | take it out of rotation; do **not** restart it, it will exit on its own |
| `/readyz` → 503 `not_ready` | a dependency is down: PostgreSQL as `role_gateway`, the retrieval worker's RPC round trip, or Qdrant | **do not restart the gateway** — it is healthy and will turn ready by itself on the next refresh after the dependency returns. On a single node (§67.2) **do not route on it either**: nothing else can take the traffic, and recall already degrades to `LaneSubstituted` while remember / memory.get keep working. Read `curl -fsS 127.0.0.1:<HUMAUX_GATEWAY_METRICS_ADDR port>/status` — `readiness.<dep>.missing_object` names what is down — and fix that. Liveness (`/livez`) is the restart signal, never `/readyz` |
| `/readyz` → 503 `stale` | the readiness refresh task has not produced a snapshot for more than 2 × `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_READINESS_REFRESH_SECONDS` | a stuck refresh is a gateway fault: capture `/status`, then restart the gateway |
| an ops `/metrics` connection refused | the process is down or never bound its ops key (boot stderr names the key) | Prometheus shows `up{job,mode} == 0` for it; restart per §3 |
| `/readyz` connection refused, `/livez` too | the drain window already elapsed, or the process died | treat as gone; restart per §3 |
| `--readyz` names `PostgreSQL as role_*` | the DB is down, the DSN is wrong, or the role does not exist / does not match `current_user` | do not restart the worker in a loop — it will fail identically. Fix PostgreSQL or the DSN first |
| `--readyz` names `the Qdrant cell resource` | Qdrant is down, or its address no longer resolves inside the registered Cell CIDR (§83.4) | check Qdrant, then `humaux-admin q cell.resources` for the declaration-vs-reality breakdown |
| `--readyz` names `the private worker's inference RPC socket` | the private worker is not running, or is running as a different OS user / with a different socket path | start the private worker first (§4 start order); check the socket path and its owner |
| `health serve` `/metrics` → 503 `health sample failed: …` | the last `ops.health_snapshot()` call failed: PostgreSQL is down, the DSN is wrong, or `role_maintenance` lost EXECUTE on the function (the body names it) | do not restart in a loop: the process keeps sampling and returns to 200 by itself on the next good sample. Fix PostgreSQL or the grant. Meanwhile Prometheus marks the gauges stale, and `HealthGaugesAbsent` fires after 2 min |
| `health serve` `/metrics` → 503 `health sample stale` | no good sample for more than 2 × the interval (each sample is bounded by the interval) | as above; if it persists while PostgreSQL is healthy, restart the unit |
| `--serve` `/metrics` → 503 `maintenance cycle failed: <task>: N failed call(s), first: …` | a door call of that task failed in the last finished cycle: PostgreSQL is down, or `role_maintenance` lost EXECUTE on the door (the error names it) | do not restart in a loop: the next clean cycle answers 200 by itself. Fix PostgreSQL or the grant. Meanwhile Prometheus marks the counters stale and `MaintenanceCountersAbsent` (WARNING) fires after 2 min; `MaintenanceTaskFailing` fires once the first clean scrape after the fix reads the failed calls |
| `--serve` `/metrics` → 503 `maintenance cycle pending: no good maintenance cycle since start` | the daemon is up but its first cycle has not finished clean yet (ADR-0062 D-A: booted is not ready) | wait one cycle; if a failure follows, the row above applies |
| `--serve` `/metrics` → 503 `maintenance cycle stale` | no cycle finished within 3 × `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_CYCLE_SECONDS` (every call is bounded by CYCLE on both sides) | as above; if it persists while PostgreSQL is healthy, restart the unit |
| `humaux-admin q <name>` exits non-zero with `missing object` | the probe could not reach its object **at all** | that is data, not a bug: the named object is what has to exist before the probe can answer. See §5 |

### `humaux-maintenance deploy-check` (ADR-0059 D-F; run before traffic and after every rotation)

Read-only; one JSON `{checks:[{name, status, detail}]}`, where `detail` holds role or variable
**names** only. Exit `0` every check passes · `3` a check fails or is `not_applicable` (it names the
missing object) · `1` infrastructure (connect refused, timeout, TLS).

| check | red means | action |
|---|---|---|
| `placeholder_login` | a named role accepted a repository placeholder (`Accepted`), or answered SQLSTATE 28000 (`unverified`: pg_hba rejected the path, or a NOLOGIN role still holds a verifier) | `roles rotate` that role (runbook §10.1); for 28000, add a password-auth pg_hba line for that role from this host |
| `probe_valid` | a random password was not refused with 28P01 — that path does not check passwords (trust/peer) or is unverified, so `placeholder_login` would be vacuous | fix pg_hba for the named role; never mark the check optional |
| `owner_nologin` | `role_migration_owner` can log in | `ALTER ROLE role_migration_owner NOLOGIN PASSWORD NULL` via the migrator principal; find who changed it |
| `schema_migrations_write` | a non-owner role holds INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE on `ops.schema_migrations` | revoke it; a forged ledger row would make `migrate` skip a migration (SEC-2) |
| `env_dsn_placeholders` | a `*_PG_DSN` / `DATABASE_URL` in this environment still carries a placeholder password (the variable is named) | rotate (§10.1) and update the named variable from the secrets store |

### Private worker: credential map (ADR-0059 D-I)

| symptom | means | action |
|---|---|---|
| boot exits naming `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_CREDENTIALS` | the map is unset, malformed, repeats a reference, or names an unset/empty variable | fix the map; do not restart in a loop. An explicitly empty value boots (every route parks) |
| boot exits naming `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_KEY_ENV ... removed` | stale card-32 configuration | delete the variable; put the key in the map |
| boot exits naming `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_{PROVIDER_ID,MODEL_ID,MODEL_REVISION,CHAT_URL,CAPABILITIES,EGRESS_PROCESSOR_ID,REGION} ... removed by ADR-0060 D-C` | stale card-33 configuration: provider, model, endpoint, capabilities, recipient and region now come from each call's admitted route | delete the variable; register / bind the route (runbook §3); a recipient goes in `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_EGRESS_RECIPIENTS`, a region in `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_REGIONS` |
| boot exits naming `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_EGRESS_RECIPIENTS`, `_REGIONS` or `_HEALTH_RENEW_SECS` | required since ADR-0060 (no default); malformed, repeated or blank entry | set it; an explicitly empty recipient or region list boots (every route parks with its class) |
| distill jobs `WAITING_KEY`, `last_error_class = CREDENTIAL_NOT_MAPPED` | the route's credential reference is not in this worker's map; no provider call, no ledger row, no attempt was spent | add `<credential_ref>=<ENV_NAME>` to the map and restart (runbook §10.4); the jobs are re-checked every `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_DISTILL_NOT_READY_PARK_SECS` |

**Never treat a `missing object` as a zero reading.** If a dashboard shows `0` where a probe
actually failed, the dashboard is broken, not the system: the probes emit no envelope at all on
that path, precisely so a `0` can never be manufactured downstream.

## 3. Restart policy

| process | policy | grace period (SIGTERM → SIGKILL) |
|---|---|---|
| `humaux-gateway` | always restart | > **5 s drain window** + B + W + handler timeout + finalize timeout (ADR-0065 D-C) |
| `humaux-retrieval-worker --serve-rpc` | always restart | ≥ one embedding call |
| `humaux-retrieval-worker --serve` | always restart | **≥ one projection pass** = `HUMAUX_RETRIEVAL_WORKER_BATCH` × worst-case ticket time (embed timeout + 3 × the 10 s Qdrant timeout + PG) |
| `humaux-private-worker --serve-rpc` | always restart | ≥ one inference call |
| `humaux-private-worker --distill-serve` | always restart | **≥ one distill job** = `HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS` + one `DISTILL_LEASE_SECS` (ADR-0058) |
| `humaux-consolidation-worker --serve` | always restart | **≥ one dispatch pass** |
| `humaux-maintenance health serve` | always restart | ≥ one sample = `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_HEALTH_SAMPLE_SECONDS` (each sample is bounded by it); SIGTERM / Ctrl-C exit 0 after the sample in hand |
| `humaux-maintenance --serve` | always restart | ≥ one door call = `HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_SERVE_CYCLE_SECONDS` (each call is bounded by it); SIGTERM / Ctrl-C exit 0 after the call in hand with a `stopped` receipt. A SIGKILL is safe: every call is one statement in one transaction, so a purge and its receipt commit together or not at all (ADR-0062 D-E) |
| `humaux-public-worker --run-once` | on-failure only; it is a scheduled one-shot, exit 0 is success | ≥ one outbox pass |

**Container bundle (card 39, ADR-0066 D-C / D-N, review fix 9).** In `deploy/compose/prod.yml` every resident
service — pg, qdrant, netns, the eight Humaux processes and the observability set — has `restart: unless-stopped` and
a `stop_grace_period` that encodes the column above (60 s default, `retrieval-serve` 120 s, `private-distill` 180 s =
`HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS` 120 + lease 30 + margin, `pg` 120 s); the profiled one-shots (`admin`, `ops`, `migrate`, `dr`,
the rehearsal probes) keep `restart: "no"`, and `deploy-check` pins both (`restart_policy:<svc>:<value>`). That is
Docker's semantics, not the exit-code contract's: Docker restarts the container on every exit — 0, 1, 2 or 101
alike — after a delay that doubles from 100 ms up to one minute and resets once a run has lasted 10 s; the daemon
starts it again after a host reboot or a dockerd restart (runbook R10, "After a host reboot"); only a container the
operator stopped stays down, and `down` removes it. Exit 2 (ADR-0037 addendum) is still a configuration error that
restarting cannot fix: it now loops under that backoff instead of stopping (ADR-0066 L-2). The guards are
`deploy-check --env` before every `up` (runbook R2 / U3) and `deploy-check --running`, red on
`service_restarted:<svc>` (any non-zero restart count), so a looping resident cannot pass R10 or the U-steps.
Healthchecks are each binary's own `--readyz` / `readyz serve|health-serve` in exec form (no shell in the image); `unhealthy` never
restarts a container, it only holds back the services that `depends_on` it with `condition: service_healthy`.

The bolded rows are the ones that matter. The resident derived-layer workers and the projection
runner observe the termination signal **only between passes**, on purpose: a pass settles every job it claimed
before it returns (card 14 / ADR-0016 leases), so exiting between passes can never leave a job
`PROCESSING` with a live lease that only expiry could free. Cancelling a pass mid-flight could.
The cost is that shutdown latency is bounded by one pass, not by the signal —
**a grace period shorter than one pass converts a graceful shutdown into a SIGKILL, and a
SIGKILL is exactly the case the leases exist to survive** (the job stays `PROCESSING` until its
lease expires, then another worker reclaims it). That is safe but slow; sizing the grace period
correctly is what makes it fast.

`--distill-serve` (ADR-0058) has no pass: IN_FLIGHT seats each claim one job (one Evidence),
work it and claim again. On the signal every seat finishes the job it holds and claims no more,
so the grace period is one job — the HTTP window plus the post-call legs — not a batch. A SIGKILL
mid-call is survived differently from a lease: a job whose request was admitted
(`DISPATCH_INTENT`) is NOT re-sent when its lease expires; it turns `EXECUTION_UNCERTAIN` and
keeps its provider slot until `HUMAUX_PRIVATE_WORKER_DISTILL_HARD_DEADLINE_SECS` (≥ 2 × (HTTP +
lease)), then is re-queued with backoff, classed and counted. Four SIGKILLs mid-call therefore
hold all four slots of the deployment for at most one hard deadline. A job killed before its
request was admitted (`CLAIMED`) is re-queued one lease after the kill.

The projection runner (`--serve`, card 27 / ADR-0052) follows the same rule for its
`projection.stream_log` ticket leases: a pass settles, retries (backoff) or releases every ticket
it claimed before it returns. A SIGKILL leaves the batch leased for `HUMAUX_RETRIEVAL_WORKER_LEASE_SECS`,
after which the restarted runner re-claims it (the claim's expired-lease arm). The lease is a
liveness signal, not a time budget: while a pass runs, a background heartbeat renews EVERY family
it claimed each `LEASE_SECS / 3` (and each ticket's family once more before it is processed), so
the lease only has to outlast `LEASE_SECS / 3` plus one renew round — it is NOT tied to `BATCH` or
to a ticket's worst case. (Before the 2026-09-29 review fix only the family in hand was renewed, so
a batch slower than one lease lost its tail; "above one ticket's worst case" was the wrong rule.)
`LEASE_SECS` is also how long a SIGKILLed batch waits before it is re-claimed. A database outage
is not an exit: the runner logs `projection pass failed` and polls again, so the supervisor never
crash-loops it against an unhealthy PostgreSQL.

`humaux-public-worker` has no loop at all: its whole lifetime is one bounded pass. A signal
during that pass is latched and logged, and the pass is allowed to settle its `ops.outbox` lease
before the process exits zero.

**The gateway's drain window.** On SIGTERM the gateway flips `/readyz` to `503 draining` and
then **keeps accepting for 5 s** (`DRAIN_ANNOUNCE_WINDOW`, `bins/gateway/src/main.rs`) before it
stops the accept loop. That window is the only reason a supervisor can observe the 503 at all:
`readinessProbe.httpGet` opens a new TCP connection per poll, so without it every poll after the
signal would be `ECONNREFUSED` — indistinguishable from the crash this table tells you to restart.
Two consequences:

- set the readiness poll period **below** 5 s, or a supervisor can step straight over the
  draining state;
- size `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` / `TimeoutStopSec` **above**
  `DRAIN_ANNOUNCE_WINDOW` (5 s) + `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_ADMISSION_BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` (B) +
  `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_ADMISSION_MAX_WAIT_MS` (W) + `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` +
  `HUMAUX_GATEWAY_FINALIZE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, or the SIGKILL lands during the announced drain
  (ADR-0065 D-C). A request still reading its body is bounded by B, a queued request by W, an
  admitted one by the handler and finalize timeouts. A connection stalled inside its request
  headers is not bounded (axum sets no header-read timer; ADR-0065 L14).

**Admission 503 is not `/readyz` 503.** An MCP request refused by the admission layer gets
`503` + `Retry-After` + body `RATE_LIMITED`: the process is healthy and full, the client should
back off and retry. `/readyz` and `/livez` sit outside that layer, so a full gateway still
answers its probes, and only `/readyz` → `503 {"status":…}` means "do not route here"
(ADR-0065 D-C). Never point a liveness or readiness probe at `/mcp`.

**Probe timeouts.** A down Qdrant fails the readiness probe in well under a second, and so does
a PostgreSQL whose port actively refuses the connection. A PostgreSQL that is *unreachable*
rather than refusing (host down, packets dropped) fails SLOWLY — `connect` waits out the pool
acquire timeout (~30 s observed) before it can report. Set the supervisor's probe timeout above
that, or you will read "probe timed out" instead of the named missing object the probe was about
to print.

**Ctrl-C is handled exactly like SIGTERM** in all five processes, and both handlers are installed
before any work starts (`SignalKind::interrupt()`, not `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()` — the latter
registers on first poll, which in these loops is after the first pass has already returned). An
operator's Ctrl-C on a foreground worker therefore drains rather than killing a pass that holds a
lease.

Restart backoff: exponential, and **do not restart faster than the readiness probe can fail**.
A worker whose DB is down will fail `--readyz` in well under a second; a tight restart loop then
becomes a connection-storm against the database that is already unhealthy.

## 4. Dependency start order

In the container bundle the order below is `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` in `prod.yml` (pg →
private-rpc → retrieval-rpc → retrieval-serve → consolidation → private-distill → maintenance-health →
maintenance-serve → gateway), and `up --wait` (runbook v2 step R9) returns only when every resident is healthy.

```
PostgreSQL ──┬─> humaux-retrieval-worker --serve-rpc ──> humaux-retrieval-worker --serve ──> humaux-gateway
             │        (binds the query-embedding UDS)     (projection runner, ADR-0052)   (dials the UDS)
Qdrant ──────┘
             ├─> humaux-private-worker --serve-rpc ─────> humaux-consolidation-worker --serve
             │        (binds the inference UDS)             (dials it)
             ├─> humaux-private-worker --distill-serve
             ├─> humaux-public-worker --run-once   (scheduled; needs Qdrant + PostgreSQL only)
             ├─> humaux-maintenance health serve   (PostgreSQL only; migration 0210 applied)
             └─> humaux-maintenance --serve        (PostgreSQL only; migrations 0214-0222 applied; after
                                                     health serve, before traffic)
```

Rules:

1. **PostgreSQL and Qdrant before anything.** Every process's readiness probe fails without them.
2. **A UDS server starts before its client.** The gateway's semantic-recall path dials the
   retrieval worker's socket; the consolidation worker dials the private worker's socket. Start
   the server, wait for its `--readyz` to pass, then start the client.
3. **The projection runner starts after `--serve-rpc` and before the gateway**, gated on its own
   readiness: the process is alive AND `--readyz` (same PostgreSQL + Qdrant round trips) exits 0.
   It holds no start-time tenant binding (no tenant, workspace or collection in its
   environment); first activation of a (tenant, workspace) serving projection stays an operator
   act (`cargo xtask projection-serve`, runbook §6) until card 28.
4. Order within the derived layer is otherwise free: the two derived workers discover work
   cross-tenant through `ops.claim_derived_work` and hold no start-time tenant binding
   (ADR-0036).
5. **`collection ensure` after deploying ADR-0083 (T-RET-6b).** `--serve` starts before anyone can run
   `humaux-maintenance collection ensure`, so a collection that predates the `bm25` sparse vector is written
   dense-only: each pass probes `GET /collections/{c}` once per collection and logs `collection lacks bm25
   collection=<name> (run collection ensure; a rebuild backfills)`. No ticket fails for it. Run `collection ensure`
   once after the deploy, then `projection rebuild` to backfill the dense-only points (runbook §3).
6. A supervisor that cannot express ordering can start everything at once and rely on restart:
   the client's first calls fail, the job's lease releases it, and the next pass succeeds. That
   is correct but noisy — prefer readiness-gated ordering.

## 5. The four OS users (non-negotiable for UDS peer-credential validity)

Both UDS hops authenticate the **calling process**, not the request body, through the kernel
peer credential (`UnixStream::peer_cred()`):

| socket | server | accepts only uid | checked in |
|---|---|---|---|
| query-embedding RPC | `humaux-retrieval-worker` | the gateway's uid (its `*_GATEWAY_UID` row in env_vars.md) | `bins/retrieval-worker/src/rpc.rs` |
| private inference RPC | `humaux-private-worker` | the consolidation worker's uid (its `*_CONSOLIDATION_UID` row in env_vars.md) | `bins/private-worker/src/inference_rpc.rs` |

**Therefore the gateway, the retrieval worker, the private worker and the consolidation worker
MUST each run as a distinct OS user.** If any two of the four share a uid, the peer-credential
check they perform on each other becomes vacuous — it compares a uid against itself and admits
any process that user can run. The check does not fail loudly in that configuration; it silently
stops being a check, which is the worst shape a control can take.

`humaux-public-worker` is the fifth process and dials no UDS, so it is not part of this
requirement; give it its own user anyway for the ordinary database-role reason (§6.2.0: no
runtime role shares a pool or a credential).

Deployment check, per host: `ps -o user,comm` over the four must print four distinct users.

**Container bundle (card 39, ADR-0066 D-C / D-K / D-L / D-M).** The four become four numeric container uids —
gateway 10101, retrieval 10102, private 10103, consolidation 10104 — with one pair group per socket (10201: the
retrieval socket, server primary group + the gateway's supplementary group; 10202: the inference socket, likewise
for consolidation), socket directories 0750 and sockets 0660 enforced at bind. Each server **refuses to boot**
(exit 2, naming the key) when the client uid it expects is its own uid or 0, unless the dev-only
`HUMAUX_<PROCESS>_ALLOW_SAME_UID=1` is set, which WARNs on every accepted same-uid peer and which
`deploy-check --env` / `--running` refuse on a node; each client checks the server's uid against
`HUMAUX_GATEWAY_RETRIEVAL_RPC_SERVER_UID` / `HUMAUX_CONSOLIDATION_WORKER_RPC_SERVER_UID` before writing a byte. The
deployment check is `deploy-check --running` (runbook v2 R10: distinct uids, limits and hardening from `docker
inspect`); runbook v2 §A1 proves the refusal on the running node with four scratch identities (exact `403` / `200`
/ `403` / `422`).

## 6. `humaux-admin q <name>` — the §4.4 probe catalog

11 frozen probe names (§4.4). Every one either returns the frozen envelope

```json
{ "value": …, "scanned_n": …, "scope_hash": "sha256:…", "checked_at": "…", "probe_version": "name@n" }
```

or exits non-zero having **named the object it could not reach**. There is no third answer, and
`value = 0` is never how a probe reports "I could not look".

Since card 34 (ADR-0061 D-J, ruling E2): **8 Readings and 3 refusals that name their object.**

| probe | today | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `stream.watermark` | streams whose projection highwater is behind the issued one, of all streams | `HUMAUX_ADMIN_PG_DSN` (`role_admin`; one call of the aggregate definer `ops.admin_probe_snapshot()`) |
| `outbox.backlog` | undelivered rows, of the whole outbox (detail: oldest undelivered age) | the same |
| `jobs.stuck` | `PROCESSING` jobs with an expired lease, of all jobs (detail: in-lease count) | the same |
| `degrade.counters` | Σ `degrade_total` over every listed process (detail: per code and process, `last_fired_at`) | `HUMAUX_ADMIN_OPS_ADDRS` = `name=127.0.0.1:port,…`; one unreachable process refuses the probe, never a partial sum |
| `flags.effective` | gateway `effective_config` entries whose source is `env`, of all entries | the same, with exactly one gateway entry |
| `deploy.binary` | the git sha / build time burned in at compile time, plus the crate version | — |
| `tls.expiry` | certificate files inside the 21-day WARN window, of the files listed | `HUMAUX_ADMIN_TLS_CERT_PATHS` |
| `cell.resources` | healthy resources of all three `IntraCellResource`s: `QDRANT_REST` by DNS + a real intra-Cell HTTP call cross-checked against the §83.4 registry declaration; `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_RPC` / `PRIVATE_INFERENCE_RPC` by a connect to their Unix socket (2 s; the listener accepting is "reachable" — the peer-uid check after accept is not probed). `detail.unhealthy` names the rest | `HUMAUX_CELL_*`, `HUMAUX_QDRANT_*`, `HUMAUX_ADMIN_RETRIEVAL_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`, `HUMAUX_ADMIN_PRIVATE_INFERENCE_RPC_SOCKET_PATH` (the paths given to the gateway / the private worker; a missing key refuses, naming it) |
| `public.corroborated` / `public.consensus_ready` | exit non-zero naming `public.claims.corroboration` / `public.claims.contributor_set` (§4.4 freeze: those columns do not exist) | — |
| `parse.poison` | exit non-zero naming the `limit_hit` column (no POISON state exists anywhere) | — |

An empty denominator table is a refusal naming the table (`… has no rows — nothing scanned`), never
`0/0`.

`deploy.binary` answers only when the build burned in the git sha (build-time variables of
`admin::build`, see env_vars.md). `bins/admin/build.rs` fills it from `git rev-parse HEAD` when the build
environment did not supply one, so an ordinary `cargo build` inside a checkout already answers.
**Release builds should still set it explicitly** — the build then does not depend on a `.git`
directory being present, and an explicit value always wins:

```sh
HUMAUX_BUILD_GIT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
HUMAUX_BUILD_TIME="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  cargo build --release -p humaux-admin
```

Without it the probe refuses to answer rather than printing `"unknown"` — §4.4 坑4 is precisely
the failure where three arms all ran an old image while liveness stayed green. A probe that
cannot name the revision it is running must say so.

## 7. Minimal supervisor wiring

The shipped wiring is the container bundle: `deploy/compose/prod.yml`, run only through
`deploy/release/compose.sh` by the steps of runbook v2 (ADR-0066). The systemd / Kubernetes shapes below stay as
the contract a different supervisor must meet.

systemd (one unit per process; the ordering of §4 expressed as `After=`/`ExecStartPre=`):

```ini
[Service]
User=humaux-consolidation
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/humaux-consolidation-worker --readyz
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/humaux-consolidation-worker --serve
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStopSec=<longer than one dispatch pass>
```

Kubernetes: `/livez` as `livenessProbe.httpGet`, `/readyz` as `readinessProbe.httpGet` for the
gateway (`periodSeconds` below the 5 s drain window, so the draining state is actually observed);
`exec: ["…-worker", "--readyz"]` as `readinessProbe` for the workers.
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` must exceed one pass for the two resident derived workers, and
the drain window plus the longest request for the gateway.

## 8. Observability units (§67.2, ADR-0061 D-G)

Three more supervised units on the same host, every listener on loopback by an **explicit** flag:

| unit | listen | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Prometheus | `--web.listen-address=127.0.0.1:9090`, `--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d` | scrapes the eight ops listeners above (`targets/*.json`, written by the deployer from the eight `*_METRICS_ADDR` values, labels `{job: humaux-<process>, mode: <mode>}`) and the collector; loads `invariants.rules.yml` + `alerts.rules.yml`; **no** remote-write / OTLP receiver, admin or lifecycle flag (`deploy/prometheus/check-compose.sh` refuses them); reload = SIGHUP |
| Alertmanager | `--web.listen-address=127.0.0.1:9093 --cluster.listen-address=` (empty: no gossip listener) | default route → the log sink, `Watchdog` → its own receiver every 5 min; both URLs come from `url_file`s outside the repo |
| OTel Collector (core) | OTLP `127.0.0.1:4317/4318`, own telemetry `127.0.0.1:8888` | terminates OTLP at `debug`; carries no application traffic until an SDK producer exists; `up{job="otelcol"}` is its liveness |

Restart policy: always restart, each. Start them after PostgreSQL and before traffic; they depend on
nothing in the app. Prometheus's `prometheus.yml` carries `external_labels.git_sha:
"__HUMAUX_GIT_SHA__"`: the deployer **must** replace it with the `git_sha` of
`humaux-admin q deploy.binary`, so the Watchdog ping names the running revision (§42.1, §67.4).
Verification is runbook v2 R10 / V1 and the acceptance drills §A2–§A4. In the bundle the three units are services
of `deploy/compose/prod.yml` in the shared network namespace (`deploy/compose/observability.yml` is retired, ADR-0066
D-I), with `restart: unless-stopped` (§3); `deploy/prometheus/render.sh` (POSIX sh) writes the configs with the sha the
deployed `humaux-admin version` prints (runbook v2 R8 / U7). The rehearsal (`docs/ops/rehearse.sh` steps
`observability`, `metrics_scrape`, `alert_drill`) runs the same renderer and configs from the pinned host binaries.
