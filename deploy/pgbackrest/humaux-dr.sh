# deploy/pgbackrest/humaux-dr.sh <humaux-maintenance arm ...> | compose <docker compose args ...>
# The one entry point of the host crontab and the operator for every DR arm (ADR-0064 D-I, ruling E10 / 10.11 J).
# It loads $HOME/.config/humaux/dr.env — the only carrier of HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_PG_DSN, PGBACKREST_REPO1_CIPHER_PASS
# and the HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_{BACKUP,DRILL,RESTORE}_* / HUMAUX_PG_REPO_DIR keys — and refuses (exit 3) unless that
# file is a regular file, mode 600, owned by the caller; cron's stripped environment is never the carrier. It also
# refuses (exit 3) when the binary it would exec is not on the PATH that dr.env leaves.
# `compose ...` runs `docker compose -f $HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_BACKUP_COMPOSE_FILE -p $HUMAUX_MAINTENANCE_BACKUP_PROJECT ...`
# under the same environment (bringing `pg` up). No value lives in this file. Pinned by T-I1 and c37_dr_script_parses.
# Card 39 (ADR-0066 D-H): a bundle node runs these arms in the `dr` one-shot of deploy/compose/prod.yml through
# deploy/release/compose.sh (deploy/pgbackrest/humaux-backup.crontab); this wrapper stays for card-37 hosts.
